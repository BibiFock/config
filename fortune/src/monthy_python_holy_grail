Now stand aside, worthy adversary!
%
'Tis but a scratch!
%
A scratch? Your arm's off!
%
No, it isn't.
%
- What's that, then?
- I've had worse.
- You liar!
- Come on, you pansy!
%
Come on, you pansy!
%
Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.
%
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.
%
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
%
To seek the Holy Grail.
%
- What... is your favourite colour?
- Blue.
%
- Go on. Off you go.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
%
That's easy.
%
- What... is the capital of Assyria?
- I don't know that.
%
- What... is your favourite colour?
- Blue. No, yel...
%
- What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
- What do you mean? An African or European swallow?
- Huh? I... I don't know that.
%
How do know so much about swallows?
%
Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.
%
What makes you think she's a witch?
%
Well, she turned me into a newt!
%
Burn her anyway!
%
- I am your king.
- Well, I didn't vote for you.
%
You don't vote for kings.
%
Well how'd you become king then?
%
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am your king.
%
Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
%
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
%
Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril.
%
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
%
No, it's too perilous.
%
Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.
%
Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?
%
I bet you're gay.
%
There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
%
- Good. Now, why do witches burn?
- ...because they're made of... wood?
%
- Good. So how do you tell whether she is made of wood?
- Build a bridge out of her.
%
- But can you not also build bridges out of stone?
- Oh yeah.
%
- Does wood sink in water?
- No, no, it floats!... It floats! Throw her into the pond!
%
- No, no. What else floats in water?
- Bread.
- Apples.
- Very small rocks.
- Cider.
- Gravy.
- Cherries.
- Mud.
- Churches.
- Lead! Lead!
- A Duck.
%
If she weighed the same as a duck... she's made of wood.
%
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!
%
It's just a flesh wound.
%
- How does it... um... how does it work?
- I know not, my liege.
%
Consult the Book of Armaments.
%
Armaments, chapter two, verses nine through twenty-one.
%
And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, "O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy." And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large chu...
%
Skip a bit, Brother...
%
And the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.
%
Right. One... two... five!
%
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, Sovereign of all England!
%
I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.
%
What? Ridden on a horse?
%
You're using coconuts!
%
You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.
%
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through...
%
Where'd you get the coconuts?
%
Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!
%
Well, this is a temperate zone
%
The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?
%
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
%
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
%
It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
%
Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?
%
Listen. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?
%
- Where'd you get the coconuts?
- We found them.
- Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!
- What do you mean?
- Well, this is a temperate zone
- The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?
- Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
- Not at all. They could be carried.
- What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
- It could grip it by the husk!
- It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
- Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?
- Listen. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?
- Please!
- Am I right?
%
The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?
%
I dunno, must be a king.
%
He hasn't got shit all over him.
%
He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin His head smashed in and his heart cut out And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged And his nostrils raped and his bottom burnt off And his penis...
%
That's enough music for now, lads.
%
Brave Sir Robin ran away...
%
When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.
%
Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about, and valiantly, he chickened out.
%
Bravely taking to his feet, he beat a very brave retreat. A brave retreat by brave Sir Robin.
%
Guards, make sure the prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
%
Not to leave the room... even if you come and get him.
%
Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
%
No, no, no. You *stay* in the room, and make sure *he* doesn't leave.
%
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
%
Right. Oh, if, if, if, uh, if, if, uh, if, if, if, we... oh, if... oh...
%
Look, it's quite simple. You just stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave the room. All right?
%
Oh, I remember, uh, can he leave the room with us?
%
Oh yeah, we'll keep him in here, obviously, but if he had to leave, and we were with him...
%
I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a bit daft me I were to guard him when he's a guard.
%
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.
- No, no, no. I want you to stay here and make sure *he* doesn't leave.
- Oh, I see. Right.

- No, no, no. You *stay* in the room, and make sure *he* doesn't leave.
- And you'll come and get him.
- King of Swamp Castle: Right.
- We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
- No, no. *Leaving* the room.
- Leaving the room, yes.
- All right?
- Right. Oh, if, if, if, uh, if, if, uh, if, if, if, we... oh, if... oh...

- Oh yeah, we'll keep him in here, obviously, but if he had to leave, and we were with him...
- No, just keep him in here...
- Until you, or anyone else...
- No, not anyone else. Just me.
- Just you.
- King of Swamp Castle: Get back.
- Get back.
- All right?
- Right, we'll stay here until you get back.
- And make sure he doesn't leave.
- What?
- Make sure he doesn't leave.
- The prince?
- Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a bit daft me I were to guard him when he's a guard.
- Is that clear?
- Oh, quite clear. No problems.
- Right.
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.
- No, no, no. I want you to stay here and make sure *he* doesn't leave.
- Oh, I see. Right.
%
Right, I'll do you for that!
%
What are you gonna do, bleed on me?

- Right, I'll do you for that!

What? Behind the rabbit?
%
It *is* the rabbit!
%
You silly sod!
%
Well, that's no ordinary rabbit.
%
That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on!
%
You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!
%
Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide! It's a killer!
%
I'm warning you!
%
What's he do? Nibble your bum?

He's got huge, sharp... er... He can leap about. Look at the bones!
%
Go on, Bors. Chop his head off!

Right! Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew comin' right up!

...and that, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.

This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
%
Oh, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
%
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
%
Bloody peasant!
%
Oh, what a giveaway! Did you hear that? Did you hear that, eh? That's what I'm on about! Did you see him repressing me? You saw him, didn't you?
%
On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.
%
Bring out yer dead.
%
That'll be ninepence.
%
'Ere, he says he's not dead.
%
Well, he will be soon, he's very ill.
%
- I'm getting better.
- No you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment.
%
Well, I can't take him like that. It's against regulations.
%
- Well, can you hang around for a couple of minutes? He won't be long.
- I promised I'd be at the Robinsons'. They've lost nine today.
%
- Well, when's your next round?
- Thursday.
%
- I think I'll go for a walk.
- You're not fooling anyone, you know. Isn't there anything you could do?
%
- I feel happy. I feel happy.
- Ah, thank you very much.
- Not at all. See you on Thursday.
- Right.
%
Come, Patsy.

- What does it say, Brother Maynard?
- It reads, "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathia. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the holy grail in the Castle of Aaauuuggghhh... "
- What?
- "The Castle of Aaaauuuggghhhh"
- What is that?
- He must have died while carving it.
- Oh come on!
- Well, that's what it says.
- Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't have bothered to carve 'Aaaauuuggghhhh'. He'd just say it.
- Maybe he was dictating it.
- Oh shut up!
- Well does it say anything else?
- No, just "Aaaaauuuugggghhh".
- Do you think he could have mean, 'Camaaaauuuuggghhhh'?
- Where's that?
- France, I think.
- Isn't there a Saint "Aaaaavvvveeeesss" in Cornwall?
- No that's Saint "Ives".
- Oh, yes. "Iiiiiivvvveeessss"!
- Whooooouuuuaaa!
- No no no, it's "Aaaaauuuugggghhhh" from the back of the throat.
- No I mean, "Whoooouuuuaaa!" as in surprise and alarm.
- Oh, you mean like, "AAAHH!"
- Yes, that's it. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
%
Yes, that's it. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

You don't frighten us, English pig dogs. Go and boil your bottoms, you sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, so-called "Arthur King," you and all your silly English K-nig-hts.

King of the who?
Well, we all are. We are all Britons. And I am your king.

I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.

- King of the who?
- King of the Britons.
- Who are the Britons?

- No one lives there.
- Then who is your lord?
- We don't have a lord.

- We didn't! We didn't...
- And this isn't my nose. It's a false one.
- Well?
- Well, we did do the nose.
- The nose?
- And the hat, but she is a witch!
- Yeah! Burn her! Burn her!
- Did you dress her up like this?
- No!
- No!

Who are you who can summon fire without flint or tinder?

There are some who call me... Tim.

Please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let's not bicker and argue over who killed who.

- You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.
- I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
- I seek the bravest and the finest knights in the land who will join me in my court at Camelot.
- You have proved yourself worthy. Will you join me?
- You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy!
- None shall pass.
- What?
- None shall pass!
- I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight. But I must cross this bridge.
- Then you shall die.
- I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside!
- I move for no man.
- So be it!
- Now, stand aside, worthy adversary!
- 'Tis but a scratch!
- A scratch? Your arm's off!
- No, it isn't!
- Well, what's that then?
- I've had worse.
- You liar!
- Come on, you pansy!
- Victory is mine!
- We thank thee, Lord, that in thy mercy -
- Come on, then.
- What?
- Have at you!
- You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine!
- Oh, had enough, eh?
- Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left!
%
- Old woman!
- Man.
- Man, sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?
- I'm 37.
- What?
- I'm 37. I'm not old.
- Well I can't just call you "man".
- Well you could say "Dennis".
- I didn't know you were called Dennis.
- Well you didn't bother to find out, did you?
- I did say sorry about the "old woman", but from behind you looked...
- What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior.
- Well, I am king.
- Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.

- What is it?
- Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting a light to our beacon, which, I've just remembered, is Grail shaped. It's not the first time we've had this problem.
- It's not the real Grail?
- Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! Oh, she is a bad person, and she must pay the penalty!
- Do you think this scene should have been cut? We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now we're glad! It's better than some of the previous scenes I think.

Follow. But! Follow only if ye be men of valor! For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel, that no man yet has fought with it... and lived!

If it's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.

When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, Lad, the strongest castle in all of England.
%
Oh but if I went 'round sayin' I was Emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away.
%
- One day, lad, all this will be yours.
- What, the curtains?
- No, not the curtains, lad, all that you can see stretched out over the valleys and the hills! That'll be your kingdom, lad.
%
- You must spank her well, and after you are done with her, you may deal with her as you like... and then... spank me.
- And me. And me too. And me.
- Yes. Yes, you must give us all a good spanking.
%
French persons, today the blood of many a brave knight shall be avenged! In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight till every one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those who God Himself has chosen!

- We shall attack at once.
- Yes, my liege.
- French persons, today the blood of many a brave knight shall be avenged! In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight till every one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those who God Himself has chosen!
- Charge!
- It's that one, I'm sure!
- All right, sonny, that's enough, just take off.

- Un cadeau.
- A what?

- Oh. Un cadeau. Oui oui.
- Allons y!
- What?
- Let's go!
- Oh.

- But Mother...
- Father, I'm Father.
- But Father...

Message for you, sir.
%
- Look! The dead prince!
- He's not quite dead.
- Oh, I feel much better.
- You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!
- I was saved at the last minute.
- How?
- Well, I'll tell you.
- Not like that, not like that! No! Stop it! Nooo!
%
You don't frighten us with your silly knees-bent running around advancing behavior!

- Meanwhile, not more than two swallow's flights away, Arthur and Bedivere had discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight away, obviously. There were more than two laden swallow's flights away, four really, if they had the coconut on a line between them. I mean, if the birds were walking, and dragging the coconut...
- Get on with it!
- And now on to scene 24. A smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, though I think you can hear a starling...
%
- And after the spanking, the oral sex.
- Well, I could stay a bit longer...
%
- Are you saying Ni to that old woman?
- Um, yes.
- Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say Ni at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land, nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress in this period in history.
- Did you say shrubberies?
- Yes, shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

He is packing it in and packing it up And sneaking away and buggering off And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.

- Welcome, brave sir Knight. Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
- The Castle Anthrax?
- Yes... it's not a very good name, is it? Oh, but we are nice, and we'll attend to your every need.
%
Well, we'll not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.
%
- Halt! Who art thou?
- He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who...
- Shut up! Nobody really, just passing through.
- What do you want?
- To fight and...
- Shut up! Uh, n-n-nothing, really. J-j-just passing, uhm, just passing through.
%
- What are you doing now?
- Averting our eyes, oh Lord.
- Well, don't. It's just like those miserable psalms, they're so depressing. Now knock it off!
%
Well, now, uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise - not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
%
- Who goes there?
- It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, sovereign of all England.
- Pull the other one.
%
- Listen, Alice...
- Herbert.
- Herbert...
%
What a strange person.
%
- Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
- Oh shut up and go and change your armour.

- Once in a lifetime, there comes a motion picture which changes the whole history of motion pictures. A picture so stunning in its effect, so vast in its impact that it profoundly affects the lives of all who see it.
- One such film is...

- Once. In a. Life... time. There comes A... moh-tion pic-ture. Which... changes the 'hole... 'istory of moh... tion pictures. Eh...
- Yes, thank you. Next!
- ONCE! IN A! LIFETIME!
- Go away!
- What?
- Next!
- What's wrong with my voice? My voice is alright, my brain is wrong...
- Once in a lifetime there comes a motion picture which changes the whole history of motion pictures...
- That's more like it!
- One such film is Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai". Another was "Ivan the Terrible". Then there are more run-of-the-mill films like... "Herbie Rides Again", "La Notte", and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".
