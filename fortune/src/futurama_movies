I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.

Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth!

Hasta la vista, Meatbag!
%
Must obey orders. Ohhhhh. Mustn't kill friend!! Ohhhhhh! Badly want to urinate!!!!!
%
Entering auto destruct sequence. Awww crap, I hate auto destruct sequence! Explosion in 7, 6,-- %
5-- Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things! %
Fry old buddy, it's me, Bender! %
While I was hacking off the Professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had time to think. Who could use a doomsday device more, the scammers, or me, Bender? After several minutes of steady sawing, I had the answer. Me, Bender!
%
Hey ! I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do.
%
--4, 3, 2, 1, BOOM! Woah! %
Well, we're boned!
%
Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars.
%
But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy.
%
Without my body I'm a nobody.
%
Kiss my front butt!
%
Ooh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter!
%
Sir, you're just a little enraged because you're dying. Up and away!
%
Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years!
%
I'm sciencing as fast as I can!
%
I can wire anything directly into anything - I'm The Professor!
%
In his (Hermes') absence I am calling a mandatory company meeting. To the mandatorium!
%
Everyone out of the universe! Quick!
%
There, I saved the space-time continuum and 40% of your rectum.
%
I'm a surgeon; when I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens!
%
You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim. Now goodbye forever.
%
We fight this battle not for ourselves, but for our children, and our children's children, which is why I'm forming a children's brigade.
%
That hundred dollars could have gotten me...one gallon of gas. %
Finally! I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows.
%
Well if the League of Robots isn't real, how come I had a whole sticker-book of 'em when I was younger? Answer that with your precious logic!
%
Bender to Crew, I have reached the Gateway to another Universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion... Hey, Other Universe! Bite my shiny metal a— %
I brought you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbages, right?
%
Weren't you already pope of somethin'?
%
If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us!
%
Bender knows love, and love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy. Love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy! I love you meatbags!
%
This isn't heaven! It just looks exactly like it and makes us immortal! Which I find suspicious.
%
Oh, don't mind him. I'll turn him off.
%
Less invasions, more equations!
%
Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? MY LEG FEELS FUNNY!
%
It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sand paper.
%
Perhaps you should see the meaning of "Fonfon Ru"! It means one who doesn't sleep with my superior officer. That's the literal translation!
%
They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming! Morbo?
%
Aroo! Those tentacles are coming to earth and there's no stopping it! King Kong's too old to save us this time!
%
Hey, butt out. This is between me and everyone in existence.
%
Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream: to kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
%
I didn't know I could do that.
%
Oh, Kif! This is just like a movie with this happening in it!
%
(selecting a neck protector from the Professor's supply) I'll take two. My neck is huge.
When will young people learn that playing "Dungeons and Dragons" doesn't make you cool!
%
Where the hell are we? Hell?
%
This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for all the chickens.
%
Have you seen Bender? He's gone crazy! Also, smell this milk.
%
All right, I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster.
%
There’s so many killbots behind us, I can’t count them all. Three, I think.
%
That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. %
Hey that punk stole our hood ornament! Now no one will know we have the LX Package!
%
There's gas in our ass!
%
I know not of this "Bender"! I am Titanius Anglesmith, Fancy Man of Cornwood!
%
Finally, we made it out of that godforsaken cave! So what's the fastest way home, back through the cave?
%
Methinks we be boned.
%
We're owl exterminators.
%
Onward brave cowards!
%
Way to kill the franchise, Bakula!
%
Now Stop! Hammertime!
%
BOOKALEEMOOKALEE!
%
Everything must be clean. Very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty. Dirty. Also that boy Elroy. Dirty. Dirty.
%
Get out of my swamp, you kids!
%
Me thinks we be boned.
%
You're not made of Tuesday!
%
There's just one little problem, and it's a big one.
%
Fear not Titanius for we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness!
%
Everybody out of the conference room! I'm calling a conference! Everybody get in here!
%
I was built by a team of scientists, trying to create an insane robot...but it looks like they failed!
%
In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
%
Eat the wizard, eat the slut, eat the robot's shiny butt!
%
Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the dices power.
%
Your friends soon face certain death, followed by a disrespectful marionette show performed with their corpses.
Bite my shiny metal hat!
%
Six, seven, eight; lock the gate. One, two, three; turn the key. Thirty, fifty, ten; my dirty shifty friend?
%
Where are you? And me?
%
Stop making your point so ineffectively!
%
Leela's not just a chick, she's the chick I love. But don't tell her I called her a 'chick,' or she'll kill me.
%
It's not all about money; although I would like much much more.
%
Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm... so... great!
%
Why hello boys Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says %
Into the breach meatbags...or not. Whatever.
%
Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can I borrow your cell phone telephone?
%
Hehehe. Quit touching my junk, pervert!!!!!!
%
Hello Blue Bird, this is Mr. Fabulous, we are go for cheesing it!
%
Read ‘em and weep. And then tell me what they are.
%
Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.
%
Go for the nose!
%
Same speed ahead!
%
My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.
%
Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.
%
Something is very wrong here. And yet, a bit right.
%
My God, I must be the greatest public speaker ever. They're suckling at the teat of my every syllable-le.
%
All good things must come to an end. Preferably in a humongous explosion.
%
Hey Don, ain't dat your wife, what wit ya had dat weddin' wit?
%
OK, everybody take a shovel, and a sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted.
%
The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
%
Ooh, that nice. Get between the toes, very dirty.
%
I'd like to thank the Academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows Vista for everything...System Error!
%
Ugh, if only I had all the money in the world...oh wait a second, I do! %
Now, I am suspicious.
%
You see this gun? That's what I'm going to do to him if he wins.
%
Say, what's that violet-coloured dwarf-like star-thing we're drifting towards?
%
Ah, I hate to see it come to an end. Yee! When will it end!?
%
Life goes on, but I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside. Mm-hmm.
%
Oh no! A rooster! That indicates it’s the following morning!
%
Zoidberg, I’m very surprised at you slightly.
%
Naked ladies, Naked ladies, Naked ladies, Naked ladies.
%
The one thing no-one suspects is that I really did stage the moon landing...on Venus! Aroo! %
%
- Yes? I see… Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who canceled us were themselves fired for incompetence. And not just fired, but beaten up, too…and pretty badly. In fact, most of them died from their injuries. And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.
- Why?
- Oh, it's got a million and one uses. Ah, that soothes the fire.
%
- What's the matter, robot? You got a rod up your spine?
- Yes, I do. That's how I'm built.
%
- Fry! You're not dead! Unless...
- No, he's not a zombie. But I don't want people to think I'm incompetent, so I'd better kill you just to be sure.
- Bender! Stop killing for a minute!
%
- You! Read the code or I'll shoot this guy!
- Who the hell is he?
- I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
- Hang on, Scruffy!
%
- What is the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
- It was bound to be somewhere.
%
- Alas, our Kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed, doomed!
- Can I pull up my pants now?
- Doomed!
%
- Sorry, it's not quite finished.
- Da Vinci give you any trouble?
- Let's just say he might not make it to The Last Supper.
%
- Time travel is impossible!
- But Professor, you time traveled yourself remember? When we went back to Roswell?
- That proves nothing! And furthermore, you'd think I could remember a thing like that; plus, who are you anyway?
%
- You incompetent crab!
- I thought you were happy, your tail was wagging.
%
- Ahh, don't blame yourself, Bender.
- I don't blame myself, I blame all of you!
- Us? How can you possibly blame us!?
- It ain't easy, it just proves how great I am.
%
- It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency.
- What are you, a whining machine?
%
- I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
- Well, for one thing his checkbook doesn't have The Hulk on it.
%
- I can't command this many ships.
- Perhaps I can help. Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battlegrid?
- I can wire anything directly into anything. I'm the Professor!
- Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action!
%
- It's foolproof! They can't sign the marriage license if I give them a pen with NO INK!
- Yeah, 'cause once they try to sign the license, all hell'll break loose. Oy vey.
%
- So what'll it be, unconditional surrender -
- Never!
- - Or total destruction?
- Also never!
- You have thirty seconds - make up your minds!
- NEVER!
%
- Unit 10 - Target H, 16K - niner, niner! Go left - I mean right!
- Whoas!
- 55U, 8R, 2P!
- BINGO!
%
- Stop, you fool!
- Nibbler, you can talk?!
- I can do more than talk; I can pontificate!
%
- Hello, everyone who isn't Leela! And a special hello to everyone else!
- Shut your lockers and get to class!
%
- Can you save Hermes "Doctor Good and Sexy?"
- I told you my name is Doctor Cahill.
- Figures I had to get mingled while the blonde bimbo is on duty.
- I am a doctor, sir. The mere fact that I am blonde and have a breathy voice, full, sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo.
- Tell me about it.
- I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes while my head's slowly dying because I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!
- Oh. Right. Ditzy Witzy!
%
- Ooh, be careful!
- I shan't touch them 'till I've had Djambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ooh, what does this one do? - Uh, that one kills everything everywhere.
- Delightful! And this one?
- Sir, the Sphero-Boom is not for sale, it's my sentimental favorite.
- No need to explain, I too have known unconventional love.
%
- Leelu is a rare toothed female narwhal who got disoriented and washed up in Atlantic City, as we all do from time to time...
%
- Oh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began went I went back in time.
- Duh!
%
- You know what to do.
- You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?
- Yes, and don't forget to terminate him.
%
- You'll need jeweller's tools and foot cup silencers.
- Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do!
%
- Hey, that's perfect! We sit back and let Dumb-Dumb here do the stealing!
- Dumb-Dumb away!
%
- If Hermes were here, he’d fire you all!
- I am here!
- Quiet you. In his absence, I’m calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!
%
- Faster, faster!
- I’m sciencing as fast as I can!

- Kif's parents come late and we have to stand in the swamp being eaten alive by damn bugs. - Ms. Wong, no. The final stage of my species' lifecycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father.
- Welcome.
- Sorry. I guess you have plenty of bugs to spare, huh?
- That was my left testicle.
- And the awkward meter goes up another notch! Ding-ding-ding-ding!
%
- Quiet down, and settle this like men of science.
- Very well. LET DEATHBALL BEGIN!
%
- Go, Planet Express!
- Go even more, my team!
%
- Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder then that.
- No crap! My grandmother was a bulldozer!
%
- Come here, winner!
- Come here, loser!
- Colleen? What are you doing? My face is over here.
- This is my boyfriend, silly!
- I thought I was your boyfriend!
- You are!
- Then how could you have two boyfriends?
- Oh, I don't, I have five! Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Schlomo!
- Hi, what is?
- Nihao.
- Greetings.
- B-B-B-B-B-Bu--
- Schlomo and Ndulu will help you pack your things into my apartment tonight!
- Welcome to the relationship, buddy!
%
- Good work, Deathballers. We now have the right to explore the anomaly.
- Wha? I thought I was playing for my freedom.
- No.
%
- Bender, we need a place to hide!
- Please.
- Pretty please.
- Aww, you humans are so cute when you're scared. In here!
- MY LEG FEELS FUNNY!
%
- I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime.
- I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door.
- Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon.
- Son of a bit! This is my house! But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?
- I tried to, but I couldn’t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!
%
- Farnsworth! I have important information about the anomaly!
- How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up in the rudest possible way.
- Yes, sir. - No! Not the Crackslam!
%
- To better understand the anomaly, I will test its effects on this Giant Medium-Sized Ant.
- What's going on here? I was told there would be Sugar-Syrup!
- Quiet, you!
%
- Kif has asked me to be his fonfonru.
- What the hell does that mean?
%
- Is the best man present?
- Guilty as charged!
- Kindly hose the couple!
%
- Upon each step is a test.
-Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your a--.
- Test number one, the test of the beer-mug.
- Yes, er, quite right, quite true.
- Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
- I accept your challenge. - Hurray!
- The test of the flagon.
- Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!
- Are all the tests gonna involve drinking?
- It never occurred to me before, but yes.
- Woohoo! Just like med-school.
- Hurray!
%
- Welcome! I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way cool rocket.
- Black-hole Hawking? Wow! If I knew I was gonna meet you, I would've done something with my hair.
- You should have.
%
- We're rolling in 3-2-What? We're already rolling?
- Love the tentacle!
- Love the tentacle!
- Loved ones, the monster-puss has revealed unto me its name.
- What is our love's name?
- Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings male and female. But Yivo has no gender. Thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of he or she we are to use the word shkle. And instead of him or her we are to use the word shklim or shkler.
%
- Now I've often said "Good news" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.
- Not dangerous at all?
- Actually quite dangerous indeed.
- That is quite dangerous!
- Indeed.
%
- So it seemed that a human had been rather injured by a knife and as his, uh, uh, blood. Yes, I think that's what they call it.
- Quite correct. Blather on.
- As he drained away, he said "Take me to a doc-!" No doubt he intended to say "doctor", but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his final word, we dragged his body to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it.
- Humans are dumb and they die easy.
- Quite.
- Speaking of humans, did I show you my new monocle? Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know.
- My, how repulsively decadent.
- Yes. But more importantly it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.
%
- I feel great and it's all thanks to Calculon. His visit really inspired me. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
- You want to co-star in his TV show, like that time you already did that?
- No. I'm going to be a stalker.
- That's not a career, more of a felony.
%
- It got Zoidberg!
- Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.
%
- I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
- Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable!
- Yeah!
%
- Who are you?
- Bender, your biggest fan.
- Are you going to murder me?
- Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it.
- Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker.
- You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams.
%
- No effect!
- See? I told you diamondium was worthless.
- Quit promoting your cheap diamondillium and look at this! - Uh-oh.
- What-oh?
- According to this blinking light, the tentacles are made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma. Nothing from our universe can penetrate it. Not diamondium, not diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! She's a terrible cook. Anyway, we're all dead.
%
- I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing; your first born son! - Jus' a sec.
- Daddy! I knew you'd come back!
- Here ya go!
- Wow! That was pretty brutal, even by my standards.
- No backsies!
%
- Thanks for everything, Bender!
- Death to all of you!
%
- Let me come with you.
- Sorry, Bender, robots don't go to heaven. - Death to humans.
%
- Yivo proposed! We're moving in with shkler!
- Y-you're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
- Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shkle came here, shkle would shkluffocate.
- No shklit.
%
- Wow, you even look beautiful in 2-D!
- I do? But from your perspective I'm just a line segment.
- A really hot line segment.
%
- Okay, I admit that everyone's happy, but it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven! It's boring! There's no sleaze!
- It time snu-snu!!
- Me like snu-snu!
- Last one to Mattress Island's a rotten egg!
%
- I am the Grand Priestess!
- Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
- And the Grand Lunchlady. I work five jobs, all "Grand".
%
- I am the Grand Funeral Director!
- Do you validate parking?
%
- Here's to you!
- Me?
- No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast.
- Oh.
- You have the most beautiful eyes and—
- Thank you.
- I'm not talking to you!
- Then I am not talking to you!
- Vould ev'ryvon be qviet? I vanna hear vat he hez to say.
- Thank you.
- Not you, ya fershtinkiner. She only laks you b'coz she laks cavemen from da stoopid ages.
- Oh, yeah? Well, she only likes you because she has matzah fever!
- What's your excuse? Moron fever?
%
- We only have six due-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army.
- Then a damned army we shall have!
%
- What’s her problem? Somebody die or something?
- Kif’s dead, Bender.
- Nailed it!

- I was in your seat, I forgot that we had changed places
- CHANGE PLACES?
%
- Watcha doin', mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in! - We're not gambling, we're playing "Dungeons and Dragons!"
%
- Eat the wizard, Eat the Slut, Eat the Robot Shiny butt.
- Well at least we'll be remember by song.
- Wait a second, I have an idea. I surrender! Here, eat my friends! Just give me one more second of sweet, sweet life!
%
- So it comes down to this, a dungeon, and dragons!
- I didn't see it coming.
%
- Oh great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces, before the light of good is extinguished forever!
- You calling me crazy!? Just coz I got a hotel in my foot don't make me a BOOGALEE-MOOGALEE-MOOGALEE!!
- Pardon?
- Stop laughing at me, flyin' avocado! %
- Okay, since I'm the only robot here who isn't , I declare myself leader of the royal army!
- What royal army might that be?
- Huh?
- When the king went insane, he declared war on scallops, so he tied the army to a boat and sent them out to sea. They were never seen again!
- Scallops musta got em.
%
- Hey Professor can I ask you something about Bender?
- Of course Fry, show me where on this anatomically correct doll where he touched you.
%
- Oh, Lord, I'm half-horse and half-naked.
%
- What else can we slay? Is that a Hobbit over there?
- No, that's a hobo and a rabbit, but they're making a hobbit.
%
- So this land is real?
- Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here you'll really be dead. But instead of science we believe in crazy hocus pocus. It's sort of like Kansas.
- God help us.
%
- Walt, the leader among imbeciles!
- Hey, they resent that!
- Larry, the sniveling middle child.
- Sorry. Thank you.
- And you, Igner. The evil I can tolerate. But the stupidity.
- We're owl exterminators.
- Good God! Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo! %
- Mommy never told you about my father.
- She said he was a foul He-demon.
- Exactly. You are my father.
- No. No, that's impossible.
- Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
- No, no!
- Yah-hah. I heard Mommy say so.
%
- I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit.
- Coooooornwooooooooooooood!
- Illogical. Illogical. Computational overload.
- But doctor, I love you.
%
- (alarm sound) Warning. Out of dark matter fuel.
- That's not a warning! A warning's supposed come before something bad happens.
- (alarm sound) Warning. Engines will shut down in one second.
- That's more like it.
%
- Who did this? Answer now or be punished.
- Fine, I admit it. It was me.
- You will be punished!
%
- Amy, cancel my appointments.
- Stop calling me!
%
- As a result of these losses, we will no longer be providing complimentary porno mags in the lobby.
- Durnit.
%
- How was the interview, mother?
- It made me want to puke my face off!

- The fate of the universe is in your hands.
- I get that a lot.
%
- Crudnuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus!
- Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!
%
- All in.
- But you didn't even look at your cards!
- Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
%
- For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret! Do you footswear?
- Hmm. Okay. I footswear.
%
- What's the matter with big-butt?
- Ah, don't worry about her, she just hungry.
%
- Everyone put your hands in the air.
- Should we wave them like we just don't care?
- That's optional.
%
- Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,, so help you God?
- Uhh...Am I under oath when I take the oath?
%
- Sweet she-cattle of Seattle!
- Not your strong suit woman!
%
- That sounds good.
- It's better than good. It's better.
%
- Planet Express is done for. What with our delivery crew missing, and the abysmal sales of "Tickle Me Bender"...- QUIT TOUCHING MY JUNK, PERVERT!
%
- I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.
- I'm not a rat, I swear! If I'm any rodent it's the loyal Capybara, king of the rats. No, wait—
%
- How many men did we lose, Kif?
- All of them, sir.
- Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other.
%
- My arms! I'll never paint again!
- You can't sue the military.
- Oh, I'm okay then.
%
- Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
- Make it so!
- It's gonna be fun on the bun...in space!
%
- Why are you breaking us out? You're the one who put us in here!
- Ah, but I'm Bender, baby, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 50 felonies at once, putting me miles ahead of you for all-time longest wrap sheet.
- You're one devious bastard.
- That's what it says on my vanity plate!
- 1DVSBSTD
%
- We’re on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago.
- Actually, it was five years ago. I remember ‘cause they washed my socks.
%
- You must not let that happen.
- "Must let happen."
- Not happen!
- "Must let occur."
