Space. It seems to go on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwin' barrels at you.
%
Hello? Pizza delivery for uh... I.C. Wiener? Aww crud. I always thought by this point in my life I'd be the one making the prank calls.
%
- My God, it's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never see any of them again.
- YAHOO!!!
%
- I'm an alien, alright? Let's drop the subject.
- Cool, an alien. Has your race taken over the planet?
- No, I just work here.
%
- I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
- Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
- Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
%
- Whoaâ€¦ a real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
- Bite my shiny metal ass.
- It doesn't look so shiny to me.
- Shinier than yours, meatbag.
%
- Why would a robot need to drink?
- I don't need to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
%
- This is Officer 1-B D-I requesting backup.
- We'll be there in 5 minutes.
%
It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals... and animal robots.
%
- Can't you just leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
- I know it's not much consolation, but I know how you feel.
- No you don't. I've got no home, no family.
- No friends.
%
- Are we going to fly all over space, fighting monsters and teaching alien women how to love?
- If by that you mean delivering cargo, then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
- Cool. What's my job gonna be?
- You're gonna make sure the cargo reaches its destination.
- So, I'm a delivery boy?
- Exactly.
- All right! I'm a delivery boy!
%
- Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
- Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
- Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
%
- Leela's gonna kill me.
- No, she'll probably make me do it.
%
I'm going to build my own theme park! With blackjack! And hookers! You know what- forget the park!
%
Oh, no room for Bender, eh? I'll build my OWN lunar landing... with blackjack, and hookers! In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack! Ehh, screw the whole thing.
%
- Hi, I'm Craterface. Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
- Better mascots than you have tried. (takes a swig of booze and jams the bottle in Craterface's eye)
- At least I have my self-respect. (laughs, then sobs quietly)
%
My God! I've got to save them! Although I am already in my pajamas.
%
- Now open your mouth and lets have a look at that brain.
- No, no, not that mouth.
- I only have one.
- Really?
- Uh... is there a human doctor around?
- Young lady, I am an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say "Bbrglgrglgrrr"!
- Uh... yededededededede!
- What?! My mother was a SAINT! GET OUT!!!
%
- The story of lunar exploration started with one man - a man with a dream.
- One of these days, Alice-- Bang, zoom, straight to the moon!
- Wow! I never realized the first astronauts were so fat.
- That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian! And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife
%
We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon.
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell tall-tales,
And sing our whaling tune.
%
- Uh, greetings Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
- Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
- But, you are lazy right?
- Oh, don't get me started!
%
- Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
- Get it off! Get it off! GET IT--uh, oh.How many roads must a man walk down before you...
%
- Keep those things off me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit.
- So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
- Yep. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to want to be a folk singer...
%
You know, Fry, out of all the friends I've ever had... you're the first.
%
- I don't get it. What's the catch?
- Oh, no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey.
%
Not one place even remotely liveable.
%
- ill all humans, kill all humans, must kill all humans...
- Bender, wake up!
- Wh-uh? I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
- Where's the bathroom?
- The bath what?
- Bathroom.
- The what room?
- Bathroom!
- The what what?
- Never mind.
%
Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all humans?
%
id he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. How's his wife holding up? To shreds, You say.
%
Not enough room? My place is two cubic meters, and we only take up 1.5 cubic meters. We've got room for a whole 'nother two thirds of a person!
%
- Wow, this is fantastic.
- I don't know, I don't want to pay for an extra dimension we're not going to use.
%
This last week with Fry has been great. Beneath his warm, soft exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
%
- I've been processing this for quite sometime, Monique, will you marry me?
- Oh, Calculon! Yes!
%
- It fits! Then you must know I'm...
- Metric? I've always known, but for you I'm willing to convert
%
Oh, fuff! Fry's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
%
- Hey, Professor, great jerky!
- My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy!
%
I hate the people who love me, and they hate me.
%
- Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
- You suck!
%
Kif, I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
%
- You know Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realized that inside, you were just a pitiful child. But now I realize that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!
- And which one rocked your world?
%
- Look, last night was a mistake.
- A sexy mistake.
- No, just a regular mistake.
%
In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.
%
We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end, is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars?
%
Kif, I'm asking you a question.
%
hard and fast.
%
- So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
- Birds don't crawl.
- They've been known to!
%
- Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
- Go ahead. I won't stop you.
- Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
- We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy... bam!
%
- Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, "the Lovenasium". Sham-pag-in?
- I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
- Well, I have studied abroad...or two!
%
- Captain's journal. Star date; 3000.3.
- Who are you talking to, sir?
- You! Aren't you getting this? We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
%
- It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
- Animals?
- That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds.
- Wait! What about the animals?
- Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
- Yes, but what about the animals?
- The wha?
- The animals.
- I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
%
- Have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
- The boy, Sir?
- You. You lay out my formal shorts.
%
- Administer the test.
- - a puppy, B: a pretty flower from your sweetie, or C: a large properly formatted data file?
- Choose!
%
- Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
- No, it is the bad kind of puppy.
- Then we'll go with that data file!
- Correct!
- The flower would also have been acceptable.
%
- Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.
- Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
%
- Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
- Really? Which one?
- Only Robannukah, the holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
- Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was "Robomadon" and before that "Robonza".
- Man, that one was a blast!
- It wasn't just "a blast". It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
%
He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroid injections were mandatory.
%
- I don't get this. Is Blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
- Baseball? God forbid.
- Face it, Fry, baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie.
- It wasn't bori- (cuts himself off) so they finally jazzed it up.
%
Welcome to a very special human hunt! We have with us today a guest whose irrational hatred for humans makes me look like a human sympathizer!
%
- A newly-arrived refugee from Earth, let's hear it for... Bender!
- It's him! He's OK!
- Death to humans!
%
Aww... It's good to hear his voice.
%
- We're rescuing ya.
- I don't want to be rescued.
- Say what?
- I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
%
- Now Wireless Joe Jackson - there was a blern-hitting machine.
- Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns. Wireless Joe Jackson was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
- Oh, and I suppose Pitch-o-Mat 5000 was just a modified howitzer!
- Yep.
%
- Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
- I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
%
- Do you remember when chocolate-chip cookies came fresh out of the oven? Petridge Farm remembers
- Oh, those were the days...
- Do you remember when women weren't allowed to vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
%
- I finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
- I'm a thing...
%
Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts.
%
- Toodle-oo!Dumbass...
- What a nice lady.
%
- I'm sorry, Fry, but anchovies went extinct in the 2200s.
- Wha?
- Oh, my, yes. Fished out of existence... just about the time your people arrived on Earth, Dr. Zoidberg.
- I'm not on trial here.
- So, none of you have ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were salty and oily and melted in your mouth...
- Okay, okay! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying one more couldn't hurt, and then they were gone! We're sorry!
%
- You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
- Uh, what? Oh, yeah, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad. And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters, atomic supermen with octagonal shaped bodies that suck blood...
%
- Okay, my friends, get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
- I don't know, I've had cow.
%
- I don't get it, Fry. Who was Ted Danson, and why did you bid $10, 000 for his skeleton?
- I have an idea for a sitcom.
%
- That stench. That heavenly stench!More...More...
- There aren't any more, and there never will be.
- ore...More! More! MORE!!!
%
- Hey, whatcha watching?
- Is that a cooking show?
- o, of course not. It was... uh... porno. Yeah, that's it.
- ender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.
- Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.
- It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.
- ansy.
%
- Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
- Uhh...... 80,000 years?
- No, one week!
- Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
%
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
%
That was the saltiest thing I ever tasted! And I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt!
%
- There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
- Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
%
- It's no use. I want to cry, but I'm just too macho.
- I'll make you cry, buddy. You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything!
- Wha'd'you mean? I was emperor of a whole planet.
- - anyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
- These things happen.
- Okay, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause your idiotic human ideals are laughable. Ha ha ha!
- Phew, that's a load off my mind.
%
- Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
- Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
- Can't imagine why I would.
- Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.
%
- I know you like cooking shows, but you're a robot. You don't even have a sense of taste.
- Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
%
- Bender, it has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf around on the couch.
- You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
%
- This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
- Puh, puh, puh... How about that one?
- Oh, I didn't realize Your Majesty was into that sort of thing.
- On second thought, I'll take that one.
- Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
%
- Good news, everyone!
- Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
- You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol.
- Here it comes.
- A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
- Thank you and goodnight.
- Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
- Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
%
- ust don't make me smell Uranus!
- I don't get it.
- I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
- So what's it called now?
- Urrectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
%
- Eat my shorts!
- Okay!Mmm, shorts.
%
- Hey, you have no right to criticize the 20th century. We gave the world the light bulb, the steam boat and the cotton gin.
- Those things are all from the 19th century.
- Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
%
- And what will you be presenting this evening, professor?
- Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place.
- I just hope it's not that lame death clock you presented last year.
- Uh... last year, you say?
- That's right.
- Oh, my. Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
- Hardly. We all laughed so hard our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
%
Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
%
- I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
- Ooh, name it after me!
%
- Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
- Actually, that's still true.
%
- Now that the garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
- With gusto.
%
Get ready to run. We got 25 minutes.
%
- Uh, 15 minutes.5 minutes."6h" minutes?
:
- - the professor put the counter on upside down!
- That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes; it was set for 52 seconds!
- HHHH! We're gonna die!...Right?
- Right.
%
- Don't worry, guys. I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
- Uh... Do you think you could be a little less evil than that?
- I don't know... Do you think you could survive a seven-hundred foot fall?
- ood ol' Bender.
%
- Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
- o! Don't come in!
%
- Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
- In fact, that's why we loved you.
- But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
- And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs, and then he sold me my mom's VCR, and then, later, I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
%
We know all your sins, Bender! And for each one we've prepared an agonizing and ironic punishment! Gentlemen...
%
- Ah, crap. Singing... Mind if I smoke?
- igars are evil, you won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell.
What a sorry fella, rolled up and smoked like a panatela,
Here on Level One of Robot Hell.
%
Gambling's wrong and so is cheating, so is forging phony IOU's
Let's let Lady Luck decide what type of torture's justified,
I'm pit boss here on Level Two.
Ooo, deep-fried robot!
- Just tell me why...
- Please read this 55-page warrant.
- There must be robots worse than I...
- We've checked around; there really aren't!
- Then please let me explain,
My crimes were merely boyish pranks...
- You stole from boy scouts, nuns, and banks!
- Ah, don't blame me; blame my upbringing!
- Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
%
Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,
Musicians need that income to survive
- Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,
With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!
%
That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on Level Five!
%
-  don't feel well...
- t's up to us to rescue him.
- Maybe he likes it here in Hell...
- It's us who tempted him to sin.
- Maybe he's back at the motel...
- Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back and enjoy the ride.
- My ass has blisters from the slide!
%
- Fencing diamonds,
Fixing cockfights, publishing indecent magazines,
You'll pay for every crime, knee-deep in electric slime,
You'll suffer till the end of time,
Enduring tortures, most of which rhyme,
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!!!
%
- Bender, are you alright?
- No! Oh, they tortured me with up-tempo singing and dancing!
%
Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet.
%
- I know Big Vinny said he was giving me the Kiss of Death, but I still think he's gay.
- Did he use his tongue?
- A little.
%
- They're laying down mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
- I believe that qualifies as ill, at least from a technical standpoint.
%
- Our electrical bill is climbing higher than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone here has been using a whole heap of juice. Probably you!
- Me?
%
- And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt water cooler.
- This is a witch hunt!
%
In the name of all that is good and logical, we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic, one-zero-zero-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one...... zero-one-zero-one-one-zero-zero-one... two. Amen.
%
- Sir, can I speak with you?
- No!
- But, sir, it's an emergency.
- Come back when it's a catastrophe.
%
h, very well.
%
- That was the worst delivery ever.
- Yeah, I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon.
- Me neither! Food was good, though.
%
- Kif, I'm feeling the "Captain's itch".
- I'll get the powder, sir.
%
- You all go without me! I'm gonna take one last look around, you know, for, uh, stuff to steal!
- You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
- All right, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
- I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
-  love you, buddy!
%
- Bender, you risked your life to save me!
- And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.
%
- Sir, remember your course correction?
- No.
- Well, it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we had initially hoped.
%
- Wait, my cheating unit malfunctioned. You gotta' give me a do-over.
- Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs.
%
But as a gentleman, I must warn you, if you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be on Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
%
Thank God there's plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
%
- Oh, God, not Zapp Brannigan.
- You know Zapp Brannigan?
- Let's just say we've crossed paths.
- Was that before or after you slept with him?
%
- Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. I guess all that remains now is for the captain to go down with the ship.
- That's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
- No, it's noble of you, Kif. As of now, you're in command. Congratulations, Captain.
%
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No!
- Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
%
- Oh. Look, I'm not actually interested in her, if that's what's bothering you.
- Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes...?
- I know. We seem like a perfect match. But, I just don't feel that way about her.
%
- Well, accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here
- Yeah, it's pretty romantic- I mean, platonic, that sure is one platonic view.
- Fry, just be quiet, I'm starting to think this whole fake fiance thing was a terrible, terrible
%
- Uh, look... Before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
- Well, you got anything else for him?
%
- This is a pleasure cruise. Our path is decided by the travel agency.
- That's for schoolgirls. Now here's a course with some chest hair.
- But that leads us straight through a swarm of comets.
- Ah, yes. Comets, the icebergs of the sky.
%
Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
%
- What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
- You mean peer pressure?
%
- This is awesome! I had no idea that Mars had a university
- Well, back in those days, Mars was a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland. Much like Utah.
%
- Wow, the jungles on Mars look exactly like the jungles on Earth!
- Jungles on Earth?
%
- All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit... that's why I'm transferring to business school!
- NOOOOOO!
%
- You robots are a disgrace to this university! Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, Robot House! Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House! Whenever a human corpse is desecrated...
- Now I can explain that!
%
obot House!!
%
- So you're saying that he just ran off in the middle of the exam?
- All he handed in was a paper smeared with feces. He tied with Fry.
%
- You went to college?
- Of course. I'm a bender. I went to Bending College; I majored in Bending.
- What was your minor?
- Robo-American Studies.
%
- It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
- In what field?
- I don't care; they all pay the same.
%
- Hey, professor. What are you teaching this semester?
- - The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
- athematics of wonton burrito meals. I'll be there!
- Please, Fry. I don't know how to teach. I'm a professor.
%
- The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
- You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
- You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
%
- Huh, err, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
- 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her!
%
The alien mother-ship is in orbit here. If we can hit that bulls-eye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
%
- hat the hell is that thing?!
- It appears to be the mother ship.
- Then what did we just blow up?
%
The Hubble Telescope.
%
Stop exploding, you cowards!
%
When I'm in command, every mission is a suicide mission.
%
What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
%
- Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
- Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
- That's the one.
- Hot damn, a day off!
%
- - Destroy all alien lifeforms.
- Um...not me, sir.
- Right. Nobody destroy Kif. Unless you have too.
%
- OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
- Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
- Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
- Gimme the script
%
- Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
- Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
%
- There. How do I look?
- Like a cheap French harlot.
- French?
%
- They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
- There aren't any copies left.
- No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
%
- Attention McNeil. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+. Okay, not great. As a result we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality!
- Way to overact, Zoidberg!
%
- You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Try some zinc.

- As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself!
- But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul.
- Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
%
- What should we try it on first?
- Try it on meow, my sperm!
- I'll try it again
- Huh. Didn't hurt that time

All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty

- Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
- Why those are the Grunka-Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
- Tell them I hate them.
%
- There will be no further questions!

- You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

We've got a friendly warning for you

The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis
Asking questions in school is a great way to learn

- Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
- Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler!
- Just make a simple cake, and this time if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
%
And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.
%
- Give it to me straight, doctor. Don't sugar-coat it.
- All right. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiance crashed into your uninsured home, and you have inoperable cancer.

%
- You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
- Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

- I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
- I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
%
- My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
- What?
- Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
%
- Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
- I never loved you.
- I meant physically. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
- You don't know how to do any of those things.
- Kif might!

- Throw her in the brig.
- We don't have a brig.

- Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
- If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello".

- The problem with both parties is they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
- The less fortunate get all the breaks!
%
- You look different. Did you get a haircut?
- No! I sold my body.
- Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great, but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewelry and skintight pants.
%
- It's time for someone who has the courage to stand up and say, I'm against those things that everybody hates!
- Now, I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man. But quite frankly... I agree with everything he just said!

- Meh.
- And freckles!

- You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!

- It really puts you in the Christmas mood.
- What-mas?
- Christmas! You know, X-M-A-S.
- Oh, you mean "Xmas"! You must be using an archaic pronunciation, like when you say "ask" instead of "axe".

Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?

- A pogo stick!

- anta Claus is gunning you down!
- Merry Xmas, everyone!
%
- Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
- "Sack"?
- And Bender, your beer belly is so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
%
- Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
- Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
- Ah, futuristic!

- Those poor 20th century women.

- We - by which I mean you - will have to rush him to his ancient home world, which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
- Oh, baby! I'm THERE!
- Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
- Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. No need to pack pants, people! Let's roll!
%
- - fatal or non-fatal?
- Fatal.
- arge bet on myself in round one.
%
- See you at the frenzy, Doctor.
- Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?
- ou didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
%
- Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
- Because he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
- Hey, I can any girl I want anytime I want! I'm just too busy.
%
- Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
-  just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.Fry, that doesn't make sense.
- Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But okay.
- Tell her she looks thin.
- You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
- Why yes! Thanks for noticing.
- ow what?
- Ask her how her day was.
- Why would I want to know that?
- You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
%
- My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilization or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. You know why? For one reason...
- YOU BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU! YOU BASTARD!
%
- Now how am I going to get rid of my male jelly?
- I'll lend you this.
%
- Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
- Shut up and get to the point!
%
- My girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. And she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains.
- Fry, remember what we said about ending your stories a sentence earlier?
%
- Uhg...I think I got whiplash.
- You can't have whiplash. You don't even have a neck.
- I meant Ass-whiplash.
- I'm just glad we hit something, I thought we'd never stop.
- Ugh...I think I got whiplash.
%
- How's that robot I ran over?
- We did all we could...

- Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
- OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- Wait, let's go by rank.
- OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
- Flexo outranks me?
- That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!
%
- Fry, why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
- I didn't find him ten minutes ago, so I thought it was time to check again.
%
- Bender?! You stole the atom?
- - It's very valuable.
- I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
- Whoa, whoa. Wait a sec. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.
%
- Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
- I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
- I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
- Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."
%
She is well traveled... and I don't mean she travels a lot.

- - Thundercougarfalconbird.
%
- Congratulations, Fry! You snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she probably has got other characteristics...
- Bender! Romance isn't about money.
- Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Please!
- For your information, it's because he's hideous.
%
Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!

%
- Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I -
- $500 and time served.
- tupid anti-pimping laws. Well, pay the man!
- Bender, honey, we love you.
- Shut up, baby, I know it!
%
- OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
- Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
- What business is it of yours?
- - You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
- This is deodorant.
- What does it do?
%
- Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
- With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
- Oh! Oh...
%
- There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
- Can I live without it?
- If you call that living.
%
I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon on your chest, to crush those who disobey you! But I guess we're just two different people.
%
- Everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
- Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
- Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
- No, you didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
- True. But, in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
%
Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

- As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
- No argument here.

This seems as good a time as any to bring up my new grill for no reason. With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth!

You were an excellent student. Too bad I was a lousy teacher!

Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro-wrestling, but it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
%
- Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
- It is?
- There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.

- Geez, Leela! Twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
- WOOOOO!
%
- Leela, you have to get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop where I stand like an animal in the zoo.
- Animals go on the corner.
- The corner! Why didn't I think of that?

 like stealing, I like taking things.
%
- Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?

When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,
With a foot and a half of water,
Everyone was alright but I cried all night,
It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,
And they said, "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,
Born to be all obsessive and snotty,"
I made my friends and relations file long applications,
To get into my 10th birthday party.
- But something changed when my man turned pro.
- I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
- He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
- It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,
No, that's what almighty Jah made us,
We treat people like swine,
And make 'em stand in line,
Even if nobody paid us!
They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,
They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,
But when push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea.
Zoidberg!
- They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
- They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.

Even if it's not a good idea!

This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now if they were to make it in the form of a suppository...

Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean. Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism, that they moved offshore, becoming an island, and an even bigger delta hub. Until the city overdeveloped, and began to sink. Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away. Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the man who invented Coca Cola, the magician, and the other gods of our legends. Though gods they were - and also, Jane Fonda was there - the others chose to stay behind in their porches with their rifles, and in time evolved into mermaids, and sing and dance, and ring in the new...

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
%
- Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
- Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
- No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
- Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
%
- You broke my heart, Hubert.
- And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
%
Help! My stapler is collating me alive!
%
- But the professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we going to get there without a hovercar?
- Wait. In my time we had a way of moving objects long distances without hovering.
- Impossible!
- It was called... let me think... It was really famous. Ruth Gordon had one... The wheel.
- Never heard of it.
- Show us this "the wheel."

Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
%
- Just the thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.

- 16 feet?! Go to hell!

- Ugh... sexlexia.
%
Dammit, Kif! Where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it as scotch on the rocks.

That young man fills me with hope. Plus some other emotions which are weird and deeply confusing.
%
- I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
- Being your assistant.

- So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall. Although...
%
- Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
- Of course! It was so obvious!
- Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense.
%
We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you think I put on this tough guy facade?
%
- And until then, I can never die?
- Who said that? SURE you can die!You want to die?!
- No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!
%
- There, no rampaging for you tonight.
- Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
- Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast, and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
- It'll be a rich, full day.
%
Well, good night. I'm gonna make all my meals for the next month and freeze them.
%
ou jerk! I thought I was your best friend! What kind of two timing killmobile are you?
%
- I canâ€™t believe this. Benderâ€™s supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didnâ€™t even try to second degree murder me.
- Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
- Stop rubbing it in!

%
For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.
%
Fry, why must you analyze everything with your relentless logic?
%
- It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
- I'm from Mars.
%
- We don't need to beg Bender, for God's sake we're not veterans.
- Then what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant back. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
%
Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.
%
- What's deathrolling?
- It's like skateboarding.
- But half the time someone dies.
- Oh. So it's a little safer than skateboarding.
%
- My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
- Beth said that?
%
- I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
- That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
- Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all; friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man, but you wrecked everything!
- Quit standing up for yourself, Fry!
%
- So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
- You wish! You're in Los-Angeles!
- But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
- Exactly, you're in L.A.
- But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
- That's L.A. for you.
- But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.

- How about zero?
- Nine.
- Zero.
- Seven.
- Zero.
- Eight.
- Please, Leela? Kifâ€™s like the sweetest guy whoâ€™s ever liked me.
- Five, and thatâ€™s my final offer. Four!
- One.
- Two.
- One half.
- Iâ€™ll take it. Weâ€™ll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
%
- Well, well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date.
- Half-date.
- Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.
- Half-bottle.
- And some oysters on the half-shell.
- Quarter-shell.

She's built like a steak house, but she handles like a Bistro.
%
- We have to go save them.

- VÃ¡monos!
%
Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
%
You win again, gravity!
%
We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
%
Maybe you can interface with my ass...by biting it!
%
- What planet is this, anyway?
- his whole sector is uncharted.
- It is not uncharted. You lost the chart.
%
- Stands back. Iâ€™m gonna puts my moves on her.
- That jerk. No one hoots at my captain unless theyâ€™re prepared to take it to the next level.
- Fry, please. Thatâ€™s sweet, but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whupping.
- Yo, sexy mama! Letâ€™s get busy and freaky, in that order.
- Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
- Eh, Iâ€™ve gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck-stop chick.
- You take that back! She does not look good for a truck-stop chick.
- Yeah, youâ€™re right. She donâ€™t gots enough meat for a guy like me.
- She does too! Sheâ€™s loaded with meat! Sheâ€™s got more meat than a cow!
%
- Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
- There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
%
- e very quiet. We're in the ear.
- kay, professor.
- WHAT?!
- hat about "what"?
- Uh...What about we go for a walk because it's a lovely day, perhaps?
- Oh, okay.
%
- If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm colony!
- But what about the worms in the other part of his body?
- Listen, this is gonna be one Hell of a bowel movement. Afterward, he'll be lucky if he has any bones left.
%
- Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
- What is it? Is it about Bender?
- No, it's about you and me.
- And Bender?
- Bender's not involved. Leela ... I love you.
- You do?
- Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
- Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait, "recently?" Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
- Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
%
- Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them.
- I call it "Caribbean Drain-o".
%
Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
%
- Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
- Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

%
- I'm Santa Claus!
- No, I'm Santa Claus!
- We're also Santa Claus!
- nd I'm his friend, Jesus.
- You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus!
%
- Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.
- Alright!
- Yeah!
- In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.
%
- Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
- Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken MP3!
- Professor, don't you remember what I told you?!
- No!!
%
- Bender can't be Santa. He's not built to yuletide specifications.
- Well, I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either, but that didn't stop me.

- We are free and fairly sober
With so many toys to build
The machines are kind of tricky
Probably someone will be killed
But we gladly work for nothing
- Which is good because we don't intend to pay
- The elves are back to work today
Hooray!
We have just a couple hours
To make several billion gifts
And the labor isn't easy
- Then you'll all work triple shifts
You can make the job go quicker
If you turn up the controls to super speed
- It's back to work on Xmas Eve
- Hooray.
- And though you're cold and sore and ugly
Your pride will mask the pain
- Let my happy smile warm your hearts
- There's a toy lodged in my brain
- We are getting awfully tired
And we can't work any faster
And we're very, very sorry
- Why you selfish little bastards!
Do you want the kids to think
That Santa's just a crummy empty handed jerk?!
Then shut your yaps and back to work!
- Now it's very nearly Xmas
And we've done the best we could
- These toy soldiers are poorly painted
- And they're made from inferior wood
- I should give you all a beating
But I really have to fly
- If I wasn't stuck here frozen
I'd harpoon you in the eye
- Now it's back into our tenements
To drown ourselves in rye
- You did the best you could I guess
And some of these gorillas are okay
- HOORAY!
- We're adequate!
- The elves have rescued Xmas Day
Hooray!

Ah, the Breakfast Club soundtrack! I can't wait 'til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

%
- Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit.
- Pay dirt! I've got the clover! Plus, his wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken. Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
- Uhh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
- All right, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
%
- It's a boy. And look at that red hair.
- ou sayin' my boy is a Commie?
%
-  wanna be name Philip. Me Philip. Me Philip.
- Son, your name is Yancy, just like me, and my grandfather, and so on, all the way back to Minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted Commies in the American Revolution.
%
- Come on, baby needs a new pair of shoes!
- The hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes.
%
- Get your piping hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cakes and shakes. We got tongue, straight from the horse's mouth.
- It all sounds good.
- All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse "juiced-in" goodness.
- I'll have the cholesterol-free omelet with horse-beaters.
- And you, sir? How can I horse you?
- I'll have a horse Coke.
- Horse Pepsi okay?
- Neeeiiiggghh.
%
- hanks for lending me your tux dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
- Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style.
%
- Gosh, my old neighborhood. That's the bench where I found some shirts. That fire hydrant. On summers we'd light it on fire. On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter.

- The old comedians were right. This place is a lot different from L.A.

If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

- Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on a highly controversial mission.
- Controversial?
- Oh, my, no.
%
- For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
- Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
- Impossible! The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof.
%
- - Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
- Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you have just got me the death penalty?
- Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
- Oh yeah, good luck with that.
%
- Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
- Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt!
- Eh, I've heard better.
%
- What happened?
- All 6,000 hulls have been breached.
- Oh, the fools! Why didn't they build it with 6,001 hulls?! When will they learn?
%
- Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is the perfect candidate for the job.
- Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
%
- Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
- Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.
%
- No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer... in this comic I drew.
- oh, the new one's out!
%
- My God! Even the professor is bent!
- hank you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
%
Hooray! I graduated. Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
%
- Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
- Hmm, I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a slight delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
- I wish! It's a nickel.
%
- o more bending, no more work! Give us a raise you big fat jerk!
- Nevers!
%
- Sorry I got you sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
- You bastard! They treated me like an animal, and that's what I became!Nah, you're all right. Good to see ya, buddy.
%
- - the guy you love so much you even love anyone pretending to be him!
- Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
- Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!

- And the grand prize winner...The Hypnotoad.
- All glory to the Hypnotoad.
%
Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them!

oday, some bad things happened. One bad thing was, a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see? People won't be late for work though. The governor lady said, "I'm sending more trains!"

- Wipe out all thought? My God, they're like flying televisions.
%
Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?
%
- And so, life returned to normal, or at least as normal as it gets in this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes. Thanks to the effects of the brain waves, the people of Earth have not memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say. I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all.

People, People please, just because its a dramatic scene doesn't mean you cant do a little comedy in the background.
%
- That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
- Bender, you said "wink, wink" out loud.
- No I didn't. Raise middle finger.
%
- So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
- It's my life long dream.
- Well, that dream dies now! You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
%
- What are their names?
- Kids have names?
- My name is Nina, this is Albert--
- And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
%
So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress. Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!

- Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
- Actually, most doctors are rich.
- What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? That's not funny!
%
- I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
- Sure!
- I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
%
- - He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.

- Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
- Tally me banana.
- Amy's a klutz from Mars.
- Sploops!
- And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.
- I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
- That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
%
- Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
- What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food.Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
- Can we have Bender Burgers again?
- No! The cat shelter's on to me.

%
- That sounds very dangerous. Someone could get killed.Fry, Leela, Bender...
- amn you, old man!
%
- Now remember Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.
- Well, sir, I'm a little nervous about meeting her parents.

%
- I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
- But you still have them, right?
- Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
- Ah, it's a wonderful night.
- It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
- I can't!What's that?
- Maybe we just made love
%
- Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
- Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
- Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
- Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!

- Let me guess. He thinks he's Abraham Lincoln.
- Well, he's supposed to, but he has multiple personalities. All of them Lincoln.
- I was born in 200 log cabins.
%
- OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
- You're going to do his laundry?
%
- Fry, stay back, he's too powerful!
- Negative, bossy meat creature.
%
Don't be a hero, Fry! It's not covered in the health plan!
%
- Back off! I've got hostages!
- Hooray! I'm helping!
- Do you have any better hostages?
%
- Fear not. I shall assist ye.
- Robots don't say "ye"!
- Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. What is the meaning of this symbol?
- That's a plus sign, ya pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!
- I'll show ye...
%
I'm not a robot like you, I don't like having discs crammed into me... unless they're Oreos... and then only in the mouth.
%
- Hey, Red. You're just in time for the hostage situation. Which side do you want to be on?
- The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass.
%
- Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
- For starters, they done hired me to represent them.
- Insanity plea is accepted!
%
- This is Frankie. He thinks he's a lunch room attendant, so we put him to work in the lunch room.How are things in the lunch room, Frankie?
- S'okay.
- Poor Frankie...
%
I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
%
- Can I use the gun?
- What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
%
- We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
- I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
- No I'm ... doesn't.
- Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good.
%
- What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
- There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice!
%
- This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
- ood news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
- I am? That's not good news at all, you little--!
%
If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
%
- You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?
- Company?How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
- Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
- Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
- Welcome to the world of business.
%
Gets movings. These papers ain't gonna deliver themselveses. Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
%
How dare they call us kids? We're old enough to find the Fox network infantile.
%
- Ah, beer. So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
- How 'bout LÃ¶wbrau? It has dots.
- Overruled! The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot.
- I can't drink that. The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
- Wah, wah! Baby wants a Zima!
- Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk.
%
- Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
- Under the seat.
%
- She just needs some gas.
- Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum preserves went dry in 2038.
- Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
- Like what?
- Whale oil.
%
It's toe-tappingly tragic!
%
Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.
%
- Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like "odelay".
- "Odelay" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
%
No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
%
- Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul.
- Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
%
You, minion. Lift my arm.AFTER HIM!
%
- Oh no! I forgot this is a hover-bridge!
- And I forgot this isn't a hover-car!
- Is any of that a problem?
- Not if you've lived a life without regret!
%
Fry cracked corn, and I don't care! Leela cracked corn, still don't care! Bender cracked corn and he is great! Take that you stupid corn!
%
- I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
- I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
- Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
%
- Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
- I suppose I could part with one and still be fearedâ€¦
%
- What do you know of this?
- Not much yet, but I am a senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U, and I'd like to help you investigate.
- You're that Bubblegum Tate?
- Well, I sure ain't his grandma.
%
- So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous, but I finally mastered them.
- Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
- Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
%
Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg!
%
- Now, how long will it take to build?
- It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even-
- Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th-
- Off you go, apparently.
%
- Put me on, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
- Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
%
At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday, by Wednesday it will be August, and by Thursday it will be the end of existence as we know it!
%
you're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
%
- All right, cool your jets, hot shot.
- Come on, Leela. Why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
- No, I mean cool your jets. You're melting Bender's face.
%
- Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at elev...
- This is the News at Eleven. The mysterious and unexplained...
- Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest...
- ...won three Grammys last night...
- ...found dead in her bathtub.
%
- The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
- Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their Social Security benefits?
- I deserve free money!
%
- That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
- etonation in three, two, one.
- No!
- Did you see it? Did you see it?
- The explosion?
- No, not the explosion!
- Then what?
- othing.
%
- You are entering the realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter... The Scary Door. Please send a man round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident.
- Ha-ha-ha! A casino where I'm winning? That car must've killed me. I must be in heaven!A casino where I always win. That's boring. I must really be... in Hell!
- No, Mr. Smith. You are not in heaven or hell. You are on an airplane!
- There's a gremlin destroying the plane. You gotta believe me!
- Why should I believe you, you're Hitler!
- No!Eva Braun! Help me!
- Eh, saw it coming.
%
- How can you guys be so blasÃ©? Here we are in the year three-hundred-or-so, yet you're just sitting around like it's the boring time I came from.
- Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome, and boy bands roamed the earth?
%
- Hey, you know what might be a hoot?
- No! Why would I know that?
- Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
- Everything?
- Except that.
%
- Far out! So there really is an infinite number of universes?
- No, just the two.
%
- Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy? Sold! To the being of inconceivable horror!
- Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!Will a money order be okay?
- Yes.
- MWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
%
- Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
- My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts.
- Aaawww... you say the CUTEST things!
%
Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
%
- Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
- Bender, this is Fry's decision... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
%
- What is the world coming to? That Fry is a sicko poivert, I tell ya! Dating a robot... it's an attrocimacy!
- But Fry is our friend, Bender.
- Ah, geez! Would you stifle there, meatbag?
- You stifle, Bender!
- Hooray! Finally, you're standing up to him.
%
Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes!
%
Oh, Fry, I love you more than the moon, the stars, the--POETIC IMAGE #36 NOT FOUND.
%
- Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!
- How much did you make me?
- One hundred dollars.
%
- Who am I making this out to?
- Ummmâ€¦to eBay?
- That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
%
- Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
- I know, and I've grown to accept that.
%
- I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
- Cygnoids, in our block? Fie and foo! They should go back to where they came from!
- Professor, please. Society is never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now, let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
- No.
%
- I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
- Thank you.
- No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
%
- Why is your number 7/8?
- All the whole numbers have been retired.
%
- Look, the players who broke the various color barriers.
- When will man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
%
- Dearly Beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life; when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk.
- Aww, you knew my favorite cause of death.
%
- Your basic bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy, but Bender was different. Bender had an 0.04% nickel impurity.
- It's what made me me.
%
- Bender, we're trying our best.
- Your best is an idiot!
%
- Danny Boy?! You're at my funeral, singing about some stiff named Danny Boy? You really are a massive bonehead!
- I'm expressing my sorrow!
- Get lost! I'd say don't quit your day job, but you're awful at that too!
%
- You've convinced me life is worth living... by showing me how bad my funeral will suck!
- I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
- Oh, stop.
%
- People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
- Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
%
- Impressive. Who's building it?
- You.
- Say again?
- You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards!
- Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
%
You know what else sucks about being a slave? The hours.
%
- Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey.
- ree us from thought and responsibility.
- We shall read things off you.
- hen do them.
- Your words guide us.
- e're dumb.
%
- You know what the worst thing about being a slave is? They make you work all day but they don't pay you or let you go.
- That's the only thing about being a slave.
%
- We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building, space travel, and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
- Also, Wolfman.
%
Being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
%
- Hey, my antenna's gone!Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it, though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little...
- Bender, no! You'll make God cry!
%
- Whoa, you look better than you used to for some reason.
- You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
- Hey that felt great!Nah, it's not working anymore.
- Speak for yourself.
%
- When did he die?
- About twelve hours ago, when the party started.
- But he just said "Woo!"
- No, that was just air escaping from the folds of his fat.
- Woo!
%
- Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of Nintendu 64.
- Hey, I know that monkey, his name is Donkey.
- Monkeys aren't donkeys. Quit messing with my head!
%
Mamma Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
%
- Quick to the escape tunnels!
- This way, dammit!
- Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows!Ooh, and a cherry!
- Hey! Watch out!
- Uh oh.
- Oh, my God. He ate Fry. Fry is dead!
- Its OK. I had another guy.
%
- Its working! Victory is assured! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter.
- 'm hit!So cold!
- NOOOO!
- Amy. Tend to the widow Pac-Man.
- akka wakka wakka!
%
You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot where I was going to be.
%
Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
%
- Why did you bring us here?
- And why did I have to take a cab?
%
- What do you nice kids want?
- Nothing. I'm leaving. But if you had extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe.
- Oh blithery poop, my cowardly lobster. You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
%
- Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
- I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
%
Your grandfather?! Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past! Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it, in which case for the love of God, don't not do it!
%
- For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!
- But existing is basically all I do!
%
- Start the ship, Leela! Let's just steal the dish and get back to our own time.
- But won't that change history?
- Oooh, a lesson in not changing history from "Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa"!
%
- Whistlin' Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
- But Sir, that's where we are building the fake moon landing site.
- Then we'll have to really land on the moon! Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
%
- Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll axe you again. Where is the mi-cro-wave?
- Sir, your wife is hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lighting fast. It only takes five hours to cook a pot roast.
- Ooh, that's good news! You know, you don't cook enough roasts, Leela.
- omen!
%
- What's your purpose?
- Alright, officer, I'll move it along.
- What the general means is, why did you come to Earth?
- Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
%
- Well, settle in. Without a microwave, we're stuck in this time period.
- Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
%
- Fry, stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorize a lot of new kings when I get back.
- I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
%
- She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
- Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
- What?! Don't ever, ever say or think that again!
%
nd you...are...outta here!
%
- What the hell have you done, Fry?
- Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
- Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
- ome back to bed, deary.
- t's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
- Isn't it obvious?
- You are!
%
- You know, I was God once.
- Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
%
- Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
- Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
- Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
%
- Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do, but you can't bring him back this way! It's hopeless!
- - "Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
%
Well, you obviously won't listen to reason... So I guess I'll listen to idioticness and come with you.
%
O' cruel fate, to be thusly boned! Ask not for whom the bone bones - it bones for thee.
%
- That galaxy is signaling in binary. I should signal back, but I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. You speak English?
- I do now.
%
- Anything yet, professor?
- I'm afraid the Smelloscope can't locate Bender. His fragrance is too mild. It's being overwhelmed by local sources.
- Hooray! People are paying attention to me.
%
- So do you know I'm going to do something before I do it?
- Yes.
- What if I do something else?
- Then I don't know that.
%
- My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
- Of course they go unheeded! How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
%
- Hmm...finding God. That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.
- I don't know what to say, other than... absolutely not! Sure, your loss is a tragedy, but our work...
- Come on, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
- He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
- Oh, how convenient! A way of looking for God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
%
- Oh, no, the monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
- Do we have to? They're monks, after all. I'm sure their God will let them out, or at least give them more shoes to eat.
- Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack! He pretty much told me so Himself. Now, come on. If we don't free those monks, no one will.
%
- So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do?
- Well, we could join together in prayer.
- Uh-huh, but is there anything useful we can do?
- No.
%
As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I faced different challenges.The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
%
- - sheep and sharks. Anyone who is a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
- Errr, excuse me... which is the one people like to hug?
- Gutsy question. You're a shark.
%
I'll ruin you like I ruined this company!
%
- Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
- The shares were worthless, and he kept asking for toilet paper!
%
This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more of a source of cheap labour, like a family.
%
- We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
- Switzerland is small and neutral! We're more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
- Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of will?
%
- We haven't made a single delivery since you took over!
- Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business!
%
- Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his forty thousand shares for the mysterious stranger.
- Forty thousand? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?
- Scruffy believes in this company.
%
Oh my god! I'm a millionare! Suddenly I have an opinion on the capital gains tax!
%
- Hairgel?
- No thanks. I make my own.
%
- ou call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button!
- Press any button! They all retaliate!
%
- Everyone's fired and we're out of business!I'm going to sell Planet Express to Mom, so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors!
- Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
%
- Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor.
- Oh, I'm ruined!
%
Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg fixes it... then perhaps gifts!
%
I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh... also, comes with double prize money.
%
Ironu... Cookuru!
%
- So, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
- Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.
- Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
%
- t is... acceptable.
- Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at. Wait, why'd you stopped eating, master?
- Because, my stomach is about to explode.
%
If it's chicken, chicken a la king. If it's fish, fish a la king. If it's turkey, fish a la king.
%
- Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings but this food actually tastes better as vomit!
- It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to have my tongue removed?
%
Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening. I will destroy her!!!
%
- You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavor. You could become the greatest chef ever.
- I could?
- Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
- Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
%
- Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
- Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
%
- Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.
- Also Zoidberg.
%
- Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
- Yes, I programmed it in for you. Four million lines of BASIC.
%
- You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there, you could drop me off on the way!
- We could but we won't. It's a spaceship, damn it, not a prom limousine! If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome!
%
Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy.

Real holographic simulated Evil Lincoln is BACK!!!

- - "No Glove, No Love".
- Wow, this is all so confusing.
- Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this?Stop testing our love!
%
- There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
- That's birth for you.
%
- Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
- I'll be ready then.
%
I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
%
- I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
- Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
%
- Just remember that people care about you.
- I know.
- Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
%
- It looks like toxic waste. And it smells like toxic waste.
- What does it taste like?
- Delicious fig pudding. Oh, that's good. But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
%
- I order you to dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way, it'll cost you $500.
- 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I can take care of that waste for only $499 and one hundred cents.
- Hmm, I know that's a rip, but I'll pay for the convenience.
%
- Isn't there anything more you can tell me?
- Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
- That is impossible, because my time is worthless.
%
- The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
- It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
%
- Leela, don't shoot!
- But they killed my parents!
- Close!
- They are my parents!
%
- Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
- Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?!
- Why not indeed?!
- Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
%
- I saw you at Elzar's with those two "ladies of the evening." Explain that.
- Okay, I like a challenge.Ah! I got it. I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with were my accountants.
- Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I will!
%
- Knowing which pickup lines fizzle, and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology!
- Is heaven missing an angel? Because you've got nice cans!
(Test subject eyes dummy in annoyance)
- My two favorite things are commitment and changing myself.
(Test subject brings the dummy into a deep embrace)
- Does that dummy have a brother?
%
- What is this emotion you humans call "wuv?"
- Surely it says "love."
- No, "wuv," with an earth w. Behold!
- This concept of "wuv" confuses and infuriates us!
%
- You could have picked a better time to break up with the ship, Bender.
- Ah, the moment felt right. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
%
- Remember, we need to show these people that we are not bitter husks of human beings, who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
- Check.
%
- This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
- Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
%
- Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! It says here that the babies lose their pajama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
- Yep, mind-numbingly interesting.
%
I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.
%
- ho are you talking to?
- No one, baby. Lucy Liu is the only woman for Bender.
- I love y...
%
 Earth. So all over the world couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg. And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
%
- Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
%
Good news anyone! The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered.
%
Bad news, nobody! The super-collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs.
%
- I'm getting a one-day pass for my parents from city hall.
- While you're there, can you get me a license to kill?
- Sure. Fire arms of bare hands?
- Which one does piano wire fall under?
%
- When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?
- To have parents.
- Whatever. The correct answer is, to be a superhero!
%
- Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?
- Hey, Zoidberg! Get in here!
- (fainly, from another room) Screw you!
- Ain't got that.
- Nope
%
- We have to keep our secret identities secret!
- From everybody?
- Especially from everybody!
- Give several reasons why.
%
- reedom, Freedom, Freedom, Oy! Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Oy!
- There's no denying it; the future's crazy. Oh, well. Don't want to stand out.
- reedom, Freedom, Freedom, Oy! Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Oy!
- There's nothing crazy about it! It's just freedom day!
%
- In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.
- Anyone who laughs is a communist!
%
- You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
- Aagh, my spirit! Urrgh!
%
- That's right, I'm a polygamist.
- Boo!
- And, in a rare double-whammy, we also find polygamy to be constitutional.
- Boo!
- I can't wait to tell my husband!
- (louder) Boo!
%
- Wow! Nude hot-tubbing - that's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
- Then consider the following lecture a bonus.
%
- My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to chose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a week with the Pain Monster.
- See you April 15th, folks!
%
- Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave humanity?
- Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is not to have freedom. It's a lesson, I say!
%
- Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to Freedom of Expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution!
- Is that so? Well, I happen to know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat!
%
- As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just because of what they see on TV.
- Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
%
- e now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.
- This show's been going downhill since season three.
%
Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
%
I got ants in my butt, and I needs to strut!
%
- Hey dad, bite my shiny metal ass!
- What?! Such an action would be extremely uncomfortable for both of us!
%
- That was so terrible, I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are, you will never work on my show!
- Yay, Bender!
- We demand Bender!
- However, you've got the job.
%
- Those ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
- That's not a cigar... and it's not mine.
%
- What kind of bozos would form a Bender protest group?
- Good news, everyone! Hermes and I have formed a Bender protest group.
- That was uncanny.
%
- Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There are a lot of professional child robots here.
- Look, there's Macaulay Cul-kon.
- He's just not cute since he had puberty installed.
%
- Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
- What was it?
- Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
- So, should we turn it off now?
- Well, uh, that depends what's on.
- Nothing good.
- Ah, let's just keep watching.
%
- Wow. They discovered an intact 20th century pizzeria. Just like the one I used to work at.
- - tedious.
%
- You can see how I lived before I met you.
- You lived before you met me?!
- Yeah, lots of people did.
- Really?!
%
- What do we want?
- Fry's dog!
- When do we want it?
- Fry's dog!
%
- Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
- That's impossible!
%
- Robo-Puppy commencing two hour yipping session.
- obo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
%
- Fry, what's wrong?
- - Seymour lived a full life after I was gone... He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
- But that's a good thing. "Walkin' On Sunshine" sucks noodles.
- I had Seymour 'till he was three. That's when I knew him, and that's when I loved him... I'll never forget him...
- But he forgot me a long, long time ago...
%
- I have a pizza here for Seymour Asses.
- There isn't anybody by that name here. Or anywhere. I hope in time you realize how stupid you are.
- I wouldn't count on it.
%
- Acting like a moron won't solve anything.
- Then all hope is lost!
%
- Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
- Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. (It's tongue comes out) Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
%
Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature... because I love you... not in the way of the ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, and a human loves a dog, and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty
%
- My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book "Earth in the Balance," and the much more popular "Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth," we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
- Sure, blame the wizards!
%
- Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips.
- I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
- WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOODNIGHT!

A billion robots' lives are going to be extinguished! Ooh, the Jedis are going to feel this one...
%
- Look, I love life and all its pleasures as much as anyone...except perhaps you, Hedonism Bot! But we need to be shut off... especially you, Hedonism Bot!
- I apologize for nothing!
%
- They called me crazy for building this ark.
- You ARE crazy. You filled it with same sex animal couples.
- Hey, there are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
%
- Oh, my God! It's out of ice, like some outer space Motel 6!
- Completely out of ice?
- This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it! Also, life.
%
- Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
- Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now.

the Polluting Medal of Pollution.
%
- With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing a sudden case of global warming.
- Morbo is pleased but sticky.
%
- Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? Is a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots!I don't hear any gasping.
- We all figured that out.
- Aw...
%
- Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063, we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean now and again.
- Just like daddy puts in his drink every morning. Then he gets mad.
- Of course, because the greenhouse gasses are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time, thus solving the problem once and for all.
- But...
- Once and for all!
%
I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
%
Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
%
But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's "edgy" TV sitcoms
%
Fifty-three years old? Oh... now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultraporn!
%
With my last breath, I curse Zoidberg!
%
- Yo, Captain Catarats. Why are we stopping here?
- -30. Just in time for the early bird dinner special.
- What about your gargoyle?
- The wha?
%
- So this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
- They're onto me.
%
- We miss the turn. We'll never catch up.
- -00 PM.
- The devil take this predictable colon!
%
- Let's all have some tequila to celebrate!
- Dad, I'm underage!
- Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.
%
- Bye Leela. I'll come visit you when I'm all grown up.
- ring beer.
- No beer until you finish your tequila!
%
- Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked.
- Oh! You sound just like my tennis instructor!
%
- But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
- Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.
%
- You are the last hope of the universe.
- So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
- Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
%
There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
%
Detecting trace amounts of mental activity, possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
%
- Does he not know?
- He does not know.
- He knows not?
- Knows not does he.
- Not he knows?
- Enough!
%
- We're back from the mission!
- Wh-What? You went without me?
- You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
- But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
- Don't worry. Everything went fine.
- Better than usual!
- We got medals!
%
- I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza.
- One pie, nothing good on it. Name?
- I period C period Weinner.
%
- Do you remember some months ago when the Earth was under attack by flying brains?
- Hmmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs, but that might have been a Mylanta commercial.
%
- Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
- Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
- Ah, she must be The Other.
- What?
- You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
- You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
- - The present or the future? To save yourself or to save Leela.
- ...One!
%
- What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on December 31, 1999?
- Clarification request! Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth, or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squid World 97-A?
- Earth, you fat idiot!
%
- You may not be the most important person in the universe, but I'm really glad to see you right now.
- Then I am the most important person in the universe.
- Yes!!
%
- Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV, I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
- And when I directed Star Trek V, I got a magnificent performance out of me because I respected me so much.
%
- When we woke up, we had these bodies.
- Say it in Russian!
- en ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.
- Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!
- No!
%
ELLLLSHIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
%
- I have an idea! Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
- You mean Doohan?
(both men giggle and snicker and follow up with a high-five)
%
- Look at Walter Koenig. After Star Trek, he became an actor.
- Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person. With my own friends and credit cards and keys.
%
...And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship, where there would be no tribble at all.
%
- Do you understand the charges?
- One beep for yes, two beeps for no.
- Yes, so noted. Do you plead guilty?
- Double yes. Guilty.
%
- Nichelle, George, Walter, DeForest, Welshie...
- "Welshie"?
- We did some musical reunion specials in the 22-hundreds, but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodeling.
%
- 'm Slim Shady. Yes, I'm the real Slim Shady. All you other Slim Shadies are immitatin'. So, would the real Slim Shady please stand up? Please stand up, please stand up.
- How can anyone do a spoken word version of a rap song?
- He found a way.

I am literally angry with rage!

- You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
- You mean the mass migration of Star Wars fans?
- No, that was the Star Wars trek.

- KHAAAAAAAAAAN!
- Uh... Khan?
- Correct.

- These bees are larger than most Buicks, and twice as ugly.
- Larger than an American sedan? How big is the honeycomb?
- Honeycomb's big, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's not small?
- No, no, no.
%
Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die.
%
- t's all my fault! He died because of me!
- o, no, no, no, no, no.I'm lying to make her feel better!
%
- Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
- - we burn his timecard. That way, his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final pay check.
%
- I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
- Soothe us with sweet lies.
- It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
%
All those times I said "Kill all humans," I'd always whisper "except one". Fry was that one.And I never told him so!
%
- That proves it! Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams!
- Bull-pies!
%
- s this some sort of brain scanner?
- Some sort, yes. In France, it's called a guillotine!
- AAGH!!!Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
- Yes...very easily.
%
- Maybe I am freaking out a little.
- A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
%
Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
%
I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse, and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane!
%
Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
%
- Professor, make a woman out of me.
- Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
%
You've fallen into the final debilitating stages of womanhood.

Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins. What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!

- elcome to my life!
%
Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals...
%
This outfit makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
%
- Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now, and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
- Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
- t truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
- Almost done...
- f only somehow, some way...he and I could drive to Vegas pick up some floozy-bots and void their warranties all night long! Whoo!
- Yay, my buddy's home!
%
- Presenting the woman who "Mom"-opolizes the robot industry...
- I get it!
- MOM!
- Ohhh, now I get it!
%
- Ladies and gentlemen, my killbot has Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available.
- Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!
- No one calls me that! I'm having at you!
- Wernstrom!
- Such senseless violence.
- Come on, let's go for a paddle-boat ride.
%
ehold, my hand crafted glory! The technological world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
%
- A working cartridge unit? You guys went obsolete years ago.
- our mother.
%
I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
%
Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!
%
Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!
%
Oh Lordy Lou, HELP! Buddha, Zeus, God! One of you guys do something! Help! Satan, you owe me!
%
Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
%
Bite my glorious golden ass!
%
- Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
- NEGATIVE. WILL-YOU-GO-OUT-WITH-ME.
- Uh, ACCESS-DENIED.

It's the Apocalypse all right. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.

Like my grammy always said, if you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself. God rest her zombie bones...
%
This is awful. Somewhere there's a more evil Bender than me. I do my best, dammit!
%
- Dig it! All you fitting in this box is like seriously freaked up!
- Nonsense, there's a whole universe in there.
- Dude, there's a universe in all of us.
- Right on, Professor Freaksworth!
- Get a job!
%
- There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
- So, what you think you just explained to us is thatâ€“
- Correct! This box contains our own universe.
%
- Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!
- Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
- Faith and begorra!
- Quae?

- We didn't see anything ...
- ... ever!
%
With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
%
Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will destroy you!
%
- You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy. You been up all night?
- Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine, it was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap.Coffee time!
- h, mighty fine smokable...
- Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff, go, go, go, go, go!
%
What to do, what to do. One 300 dollar hookerbot or 300 one dollar hookerbots?
%
The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
%
- - Noun. You! This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts.
%
- Dwight, the boots only cost me 299 dollars and 99 cents. Here, you spend the penny on whatever you want.
- Thanks, dad. I think I'll invest it on five shares of Amazon.com.
- A risk taker. That's my boy.

The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab, by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them.

- Well, you asked the right guy. I'm the whale biologist. Though personally I hate whales. Especially Mushu.

- Eew!
- Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster. What do I care what you think?

- For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
- She also liked to shut up.
%
We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
%
- Don't tell me you believe in Bigfoot, you blithering ninny-hammer.
- Of course I do. Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.
- Why?
- 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters, yet longed to be one.
- I can so relate to that.
- Enough with the emotions. This isn't a fat camp.

One of these days, Ndnd - bang, zoom, straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!
%
Fry, what in Sega Genesis happened?
%
- Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
- I'll say! Wooooo!
- But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
- That's what she said! Wooooo!
%
- Mmm, this jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
- It's used to it. Woooo!
%
- Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
- (Off screen) Just like at the movie theater! Woooo!
%
- This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
- n this case "small"! Wooooo!
%
- Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
- As usual! Wooooo!
%
- You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.
- I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
- It turns out it's Man
%
This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
%
- Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera!
- But I can't play anymore!
- Yes you can! The music was in your heart, not your hands!
- Your music is bad and you should feel bad!
%
- Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
- At, uh, uh, a concert.
- Ooh, was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
- So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
- Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pasty and hunched--
- retty boy...
- But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibers on his butt.
%
- That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
- Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
%
- Look, what do you want?
- I want my hands back.
- Never!
A deal's a deal, even with a dirty dealer.
- Very well,
Then I'll take what I want from Leela.
- Leela has promised me her hand.
- Fry, you do not understand.
I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender, the shame, the shame,
But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendor,
Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,
He gave me mechanical ears, effective though just a bit garish,
In return without shedding a tear, I agreed that I'd give him my handâ€”
- In marriage!
- What?
- You'd give me your hand in marriage.
- Is this really happening or just being staged?
- It can't be realâ€”
- Not if Leela is engaged.
- That isn't what I meant, that isn't what I signed.
- You should have checked the wording in my fine...Print.
- "I'll give you my hand..."
- "In marriage."
- "The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention",
Now...that...IS "irony".
- I will marry her now and confine her to hell, how droll, how droll!
Where Styx is a river, and not just a band,
Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,
Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!
- Destiny has cheated me,
By forcing me to decide upon,
The woman that I idolize,
Or the hands of an automaton,
Without these hands I can't complete,
The opera that was captivating her,
But if I keep them, and she marries him,
Then he probably won't want me dating her...
- Arooo!
- Bray-vo! Enn-core!
- I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
- I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
- By the power vested in me, by the state of New New Yorkâ€”
- No! Stop! Take my hands! You evil, metal dork!
%
Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
%
n the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots and then brought back by bigger idiots. One... two...
%
- Well, why is... those things?
- You mean you don't remember?
- Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead.
%
Fire all weapons and set a transmission frequency for my victory yodel.
%
- Sweet coincidence of Port-Au-Prince! We're back on Earth!
- Of course! That was the Panama Wormhole, the universe's central transportation channel
- ow humorous.

%
Yet thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tirbial brain dablige.

Who are you, my warranty?

Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma chameleon!
%
Nah.Now that I like for some reason.
%
- Yeah! Do the Bender! Do the Bender!

-  SAID "DO IT!!!!!"
%
- There's no room for two captain's butts in this chair!
- There would be if you'd have taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!
%
- Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?
- I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
%
Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
%
- My god, we're defenceless. Like fish in a barrel.
- Options?
- My instinct is to hide in this barrel, like the wily fish.
%
This is it. The moment we should have trained for.
%
Mr. President, what the hell?
%
I don't like the looks of this V-GINY.
%
I surrender and volunteer for treason!
%
V-GINY? Doesn't ring a bell.
%
- Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
- That makes the most sense of all.
- Look at the planets it's destroyed so far. First came X3, the nude beach planet. Then Poopiter.
- And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.
- You mean...
- o you're saying this thing is censoring indecent planets?
- Indeed. And we're next if we don't keep in in our collective pants. The only way to save Earth is to convince its citizens to repent their sinful ways.
- o the orgy is off?
%
- Come, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.
- Thee will be done.
%
- For God's sake! Censor it! Censor it!
- Approved for all audiences!
- Nooooo!

- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Oops! Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I'm in love with a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.

- But youâ€™re my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
- Oh, perhaps Iâ€™ve been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and Iâ€™ll explain why I find you so repugnant.

In the year 252525,
The backwards time machine still won't have arrived.
In all the world, there's only one technology,
A rusty sword for practicing proctology!
In a future year that ends with a twenty (351120),
A shlubby merman's gonna try to get chummy.
He may look like a watery wimp,
When in fact he's a bloodthirsty shrimp!
In the year 1000000&1/2,
Humankind is enslaved by giraffe.
Man must pay for all his misdeeds,
When the treetops are stripped of their leaves!

- So Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I don't like her in the Professor's disgusting body.
- You do, don't you?
- Of course, but I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?

%
- I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people.

When I cane you from the comfort of my sled.
- On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,
Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.
- And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,
It can be re-gifted straight to Santa's ass.
- But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,
The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.
The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous
Is a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.
- We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
- ou're welcome.
%
- I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!

But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.
So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,
Which will give me time to quickly make them up.

- Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
- Do you eat these yummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
- Better!
We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins!
Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
- Why with the music so loud?
- Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
- But by far the most important thing is oil.
- To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
- No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle.
- The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so special
Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.

Sumthin' 'bout a pine tree and a oil-wrestlin' dealy?
- That's from Xmas and Robanukah, you plagiarizing lout!
- Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out.
But before I go, the most important thing...
- What's that, Black Santa?

But they best be made of beeswax or y'all might as well be white.

- Then Protocol 63 it is.
%
They're flying Manhattan into the sun. They must have been out of piranhas.

- Double time, soldier. I want this ice fishing operation up and running by 0800 hours.
- t's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off.
- Pfft! You don't know what cold is. I once survived an entire week trapped in a Swiss glacier eating nothing but frozen Neanderthal. To this day, I can't stand the taste of early hominid.
%
- Hey, Barack! Pizza goin' out. Come on!
- Man, I've got to go back to law school.
- ffft! I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
%
- This may take a while. I've got to adjust the memory timing, raise the CPU voltage, and delete twelve terabytes of outdated catchphrases.
- Sounds like fun on the bun!
- Deleted.
%
- Don't you ever wonder about the future?
- Well, sure, but you're always in it.
- Also, sometimes Terminators.
%
- Farnsworth? What a lucky break, after all these years I've got him, and legally too.
- Even an idiot like me knows he'll be ruined.
- An idiot like you is correct!
%
Good news, everyone! That's what the Professor would say if he weren't in jail facing a life sentence.
%
- Oh god! I clicked without reading.
- And I slightly modified a thing that I own.
Professor Farnsworth We're monsters!

A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it; it might be you. Stand by for "Reincarnation".

Movietone News, everyone!
%
- Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space dame like her would ever marry a two-bit low-life delivery boy like me? And also, I have bad posture some severe financial problems?
- Have you tried gettin' her pregnant?
- Gosh, yes! I've tried and tried! But, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.
%
Watch it, you stumble bums! You're boopin' my Betty!
%
Is my eye playing trick on me?
%
Th-th-that's all you get, chumps!
%
All right, diamond. You won those round, but I have an ace up my hole.
%
- A guy like me can't afford a diamond ring for a gal like her.
- That's for sure, not on the measly salary I steal from you every week.
%
Byte my 8 bit metal ass.That's byte with a 'Y'.
%
- Oh my, there's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole at the bottom of the sea.
- And that's the ultimate secret of the universe?
- Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole on the bottom of the sea. The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms...
- Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
- Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope!
%
ould it cheer you up if I punch Fry in the groin? Cause I'll do it, regardless.
%
Fry, you idiot, you're a genius!
%
- You solved the problem that drove Einstein and forced Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice-actor.
- I like physics, but I love cartoons.
%
- What is that box, you old witch?
- Ha ha ha ha! I'll never tell you! It's a deep space emotion detector.
- The detector detects that you are impressed.
%
Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything.
%
- All attempts to communicate with the aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle.
- Power Friends Go!
%
- Here my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard.
- Custard Time?! Hooray!
%
- Of course! Having no mouths or ears they can only communicate through motions!
- Or perhaps by odors.
- That is how you communicate.
- Hahahahahahaha!
%
ey aliens, we will kill you! And dishonor your widows by making them gather wood!
%
- Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all.
- For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arisenext week at the same time!
%
Aw, he's so cute. Wait, no, he isn't. He looks like Bender!
%
- Didn't your mom ever tell you where robot babies come from?
- No, she was a religious fundamentalist, plus she didn't have a mouth. It's an unusual combination.
%
I hate to crush a boy's dreams, but...What the heck!
%
- Awh, I'm gonna call him Ben, after the first half of me, Bender!
- That's my bastard!
%
That's it, Fry! For a guy who's not too bright, you're too damn bright!
%
- There's a dam!
- Damn!
- There's a grate!
- Great!
%
- I hope you're not too mad at me, Leela. For tearing your arm off and all.
- I can't be mad, I'm on way too many painkillers. Plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live. I mean you failed miserably, but you're only person who loves me enough to try.
%
What an idiot I was! And by "I", I meant "you"!
%
Damn thing won't turn over, like Pat on Sunday morning.
%
- My lucky pants!
- They don't look so lucky to me.
- They are too lucky! I was wearing them when I found a dime in my ear, when I got a free subscription to Redbook, and when I first met Leela.
- Aw! Also, oh, Lord.
- Also, they're my only pants.
- You wore the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it.

This is the first time a presidential candidate got to see his own birth live.
%
- If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance of beating Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery.And I'm just the guy for the job!
- AROOO!
%
- Look, let's be honest here. No one likes taxes. But they pay for our basic needs. Roads, schools, defense. If we hope to realise our aspirations as a great planet, we must each pay our fair share to achieve those noble goals.
- Thank you, Senator. A thoughtful and lucid answer. You will be destroyed!!
%
- This is crazy! You're from the future?
- Yes. I was sent back from the year 3028 to prevent Nixon from getting elected.
- I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
%
- Film? Who uses film? We've had digital cameras for a thousand years!
- Digital?No digital camera can capture the warmth and grain o' good, ol' film.
- How can you even tell? Your eyes are digital cameras.
%
- ow, your only chance is a classic death scene, one with a lot of thy's and thou's.
- VoÃ­la! The tragic end of "Rome-o and Julie-t."
- That's Romeo and Juliet, dummy...by will.i.am Shakespeare.
%
- Very well. Morris, Munda, I now pronounce you man and wife. May I kiss the bride?
- Congratulations.
%
- We're under attack and the wedding's off. Kif, return fire AND the cake.

Sweet orgy of Georgia! Have you girls gone wild?

With one-sixth gravity, you can work and be lazy at the same time! It's like being a voice actor!

Once again, Eternliax the Immortal, dead, at the age of 26.

No more implants. I don't want to end up a cold, emotionless machine like you.

- You don't understand. He was the only one who cared enough to insult me.
- I insult you, you fat sack.
- Sure, when it's convenient.
%
- Zoidberg this makes no sense. Why are you helping him?
- And what's with that catchy beat?
- I'll tell you, 2, 3, 4.
I was lonesome for my friend a minute ago.
When a happy thought dispelled my wall
And I fell perhaps he'd be a bit last doll
- If I sliced up his Cyborgs scull
- He wants a brain
- He wants a robot brain
- Another brain
- Let see if he fells pain
- A brand new brain
- It might drive him insane
- He wants a brain.
- He wants a robot brain
- wa uuuuuuuuuu wa wa uuuuuuuuu wa wa uuuuuuuuuu wa wa uuuuuuuu...
- Does anybody else find it freaky that Zoidberg is singing harmony with himself?
- Oh, loosen up, Amy!
%
- For once, I thought it might be nice to do something in a social setting! Finally get to know each other. Why, I don't even know half your names!You, boy! What do they call you?
- Most folks just call me 'Orange Joe'.

Hey, Elzar! I've just recently started always having dreamt of being a sausage making champion

Foolproof and durable; it's designed to withstand the weight of a modern day elephant foot.

Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those!
%
- How does a robot join this monk outfit?
- Just put on this monk outfit.
%
- I gotta mope things over for a while.
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I think he's shuffling off sadly in the distance.
- Oh lord.
%
- Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones and you'll wind up face down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
- Still, to have your own pool!
%
- It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
- Mon, you had one hell of a day.
%
- Fry, you're so confident and take charge on this trip! It's kind of a turn-on.
- Not now, Leela, I'm trying to meet old people!
%
- It's so wonderful to meet the Professor's parents!Hello, my name is Dr. Zoidberg. I'm very important here.
- Hey, Zoidberg! You forgot to empty this trashcan!
- on't hit me!
%
- Ahem!
- Oh what? Oh yeah your award show? I'm sorry I couldn't make it but I had a very good reason!
- Perhaps you'd favor us with it?
- Sure my pleasure. I came down with a searing case of... who gives a crap?! HAHAHAHA!!
%
- Hmmmm... Hats with wires on them. Are you sure this is safe?
- It's not just safe; it's 40% safe.
%
Fox news, everyone! I've decided to make the fox our new corporate mascot!
%
It's Bender's middle finger. I'd recognize this anywhere.
%
od, it's Zoidberg. I hate to bother you, but-Okay, okay, I'll shut up!
%
Look out, penny slots, I've got a system! It's to put all my money in you!
%
- My God! He was so saturated with ink that his entire body structure was polarized!
- You mean I'm invisible?
- No, no, no, not in any sense of the word. But essentially, yes, entirely.
%
- Still, six of ten alive! That's considered good for our species.
- Five out of ten, also nice.
- Yep.
%
- Oh-ho I'm good! Who wants a piece of me?
- I'll try-a-bite!
%
(his dying words) Tell my kids I love me... very much.

- The isolated Galapagos Islands, a veritable pageant of evolutionary science â€“ home to dozens of species found nowhere else, such as Darwin's Finches and the marine iguana.
- Also, the Blue-footed Booby! That's fairly interesting. Note the blue coloration of the fâ€”
%
Sad news everyone. I'm lonesome.
%
- Bite my freshly-molted, blubber-filled ass!
- You're just a giant lump of fat. Do you even have an ass under there?
- I'm 40% ass.
%
- That's it, you hoodlums! Your mouth just wrote a PayPal transfer request that your butt has insufficient funds to honor!
- Yo. It is on! Before that it was off.
%
- o you think they're...dead?
- No, no. I choose to believe they're alive in some other dimension. Screamin' in agony.
- I hope so.
%
- Yum, apples!Hey, how come I can't swallow?
- Hmm, I guess it's because our two-ended digestive system can't exist in this dimension. I suppose that could be an issue.
- I knew it! I knew he'd get us killed somehow!
- As you can see, or rather can't see, but take my word for it, such a digestive system would divide a 2D being into separate pieces!
%
He's opening our minds to new ideas. Kill him!
%
- I'm not sure this marmoset disguise is working...
- I'm not sure either. We better ask Amy!
%
- An-and the robot hands would make you a strawberry shortcake any time of day. Four, seven, any time!
- No way!
- I'm not lyin'!
%
- Sean, I'd like you to meet Fry, he and I are... What would you say we are, Fry?
- Nude and interrupted.
%
Good news, everyone! I'm in terrible pain.
%
- Sir, there's an Omicronian ship requesting safe passage home.
- Home, eh? That's where I live! Let 'em through the blockade.
%
- Five-O! Five-O!
- Five what?
- Five Omicronians!
%
- Bender. Do you know where Fry is? I haven't seen him since we got back from Omicron Persei 8.
- Fry?! You... just missed him. He went out to buy you flowers. Whatever kind you like best. 'Cuz he loves you and crap.
%
Jrrr! How do I watch a funny on the YouTube?
%
- Can you save him?
- I could, but he'd only live another 80 years at most. The humane thing is to put him to sleep.
%
- What's happening? Why's his butt glowing?
- The electromagnetic intensity of the robot's friendship is causing the herbs in his bowels to bioluminesce with love. Probably.
%
- Using my fancy technology, I can make an exact copy of this guitar.
- Tell me Doctor Beeler, will I need to threaten you?
- Not at all! You see nowadays, we can take a unique and beautiful object, and easily reduce it to a formula for mass production! I call the process "Science"!
%
(in -) WOAH! That's a lot of porn!
%
I failed at my life-long dream again. How can I be so bad at everything I try, and still be so great?
%
But, robot, you can't just make up a folk song like you can a medical diploma, they have to come from the heart!
%
These boys must have hero in their bones, and you, ma'am, must have heroine in your veins.

Polar bears don't burn! I've tried many times!

We can have 4 idiots and a fat guy, but no arsonist!

There is no fire department! I sold it to pay for Bender's medal!

I'll stay here and be in charge of 'not dying'

Uhm, Leela, remember when we were trying to guess what would happen if someone stuck a gun in my face and you said I'd probably crap my pants? Well...

Isn't it bad enough that I occasionally lay an egg? Now I have to become a squid too?!!

- Have you been using my toothbrush to polish your ass again?!

%
You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
%
I'm sorry, Zoidberg, I can't see you anymore. Something's come up. It's vomit.
%
First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming!Owch! I forgot I was a giant crab!

Avenge us.

- Classy choice, Chief. She'll crap her pants.

- I've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast. It should rip us out of stasis back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button.
