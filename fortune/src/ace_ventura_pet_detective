If I'm not back in five minutes... just wait longer.

- Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Did you have any trouble getting in?
- No, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle.
%
- Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.
- ...and a clean pair of shorts.
%
-  Ventura.
- Yes Satan.
- Ohh, I thought you were someone else.
%
- You know, you're just mad because your stupid little pebble theory didn't work out and you don't know how to express your anger.
- Oh yeah? And you're ugly.
%
- Holy testicle Tuesday.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I came to confess. I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll.
%
-  Thank you Mr. Ventura. Is there any way I can repay you?
- Well, a reward would be nice. I sustained some damage to my vehicle. Had to fill it with premium.
- Wouldn't you like me to take your pants off instead?
-  Gee, let me think. Um, sure!
%
It was all that Dan Marino's fault, everyone knows that. If he had held the ball, laces out, like he was supposed to, Ray would never have missed that kick. Dan Marino should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell. Would you like a cookie, son?
%
- Ventura, when I get out of that bathroom, you better be gone.
- Is it number one or number two? I just want to know how much time I have.
%
- Ace, get out of the tank.
-  I just can't do it, Captain. I don't have the power.
- I said, get out of the tank now!
- For God's sake, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a pool man!
%
- That was pretty impressive, what you did at the apartment.
- You don't have to tell me. I was there.
%
- Listen, pet dick. How would you like me to make your life a living hell?
- Well, I'm not really ready for a relationship, Lois, but thank you for asking. Hey, maybe I'll give you a call sometime. Your number's still 911? All righty then.
%
LOOO-HOOO-ZUH-HER!
%
- Homicide, Ventura. Now how ya gonna solve that one?
- Good question, Aguado. First, I'd establish a motive. In this case the killer saw the size of the bug's DICK, and became insanely jealous.
- Then I'd lose 30 pounds... porkin' his wife!
- Why you...!
- Now, kiss and make up.
%
-  How can I be getting zis vork done wit all de shouting? Control de shouting?
- Who's That?
- Heinz Getwellvet. I am trainer of dolphins. You want to talk to de dolphin, you talk to me.
- What happened to the *regular* trainer?
- Vat happened to him? Vat happened to me? Seven years I am wit Siegfried.
- Ve are making de dolphins disappear, und den Roy is coming wit de vite tiger und ze shtuffing in de pants und den I'm gone.
-  Where is Snowflake?
- Why do you care about Snowflake? Do you know him? Does he call you at home?
- Do you have a dorsal fin? To train ze dolphin you must zink like ze dolphin! You must be getting inside ze dolphin's head. I am saying to Snowflake, "Akay!... Akay Akay Akay?" und he is saying "AKay Akay!" und he is up on ze tail "Eeeeeeeeee!" und you can quote him!
- Alright, it's almost time for Coach Shula's press confrence, uh, lets let Heinz do his work?
-  Go to de conference, go to it.
%
- We'll find the porpoise.
-  Whew... now I feel better. 'Course, that might not do any good you see nobody's missing a porpoise. It's a dolphin that's been taken. The common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth and a triangular thoracic fin. While the bottlenose dolphin, or Tursiops truncates, has an elongated beak, round cone shaped teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage. But I'm sure you already knew that. That's what turns me on about 'cha, your attention to detail.
%
Do *not* go in there! Pheeww!
%
 Captain's Log, stardate 23.9, rounded off to the... nearest decimal point. We've... traveled back in time to save an ancient species from... total annihilation. SO FAR... no... signs of aquatic life, but I'm going to find it. If I have to tear this universe another black hole, I'm going to find it. I've... GOT TO, MISTER.
%
- What do you know about Ray Finkle?
- Soccer style kicker graduated from Collier High June 1976, Stetson University honors graduate class of 1980, holds 2 NCAA Division One records, one for most points in a season, one for distance, former nickname "The Mule," the first and only pro-athlete ever to come out of Collier County and one hell of a model American.
- Are you another one of those "Hard Copy" guys?
- No sir, I'm just a very big Finkle fan. This is my Graceland.
%
- What the... That's it! Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is Einhorn! Einhorn is a man!
- Oh, my GOD! Einhorn is a man!
%
- Hey Ace?
- Yeah, Dan?
- You got anymore of that gum?
- That's none of your damn business and I'll thank you to stay out of my personal affairs.
- You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.
%
-  What do you want?
- HDS, sir, and how are you this afternoon? All righty, then. I have a package for you.
- Sounds broken.
- Most likely, sir. I'll bet it was something nice, though.
%
- Ventuuurrraaa.
- Yes, Satan? Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded like someone else.
- Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura...
- ... you owe me rent.
- Mr. Shickadance, I told you - you're my first priority. I'm on a very big case right now. Check this out.
- That's a true Albino pigeon. Some rich guy lost it. He's offering a $25,000 reward. As soon as I find this bird, you're paid.
- I heard animals in there, Ventura. I heard 'em again this mornin' scratchin' around.
- I never bring my work home with me, sir.
- Oh yeah? What's all this pet food for?
- Fiber.
%
- This is double-paned sound-proof glass. There is no way that neighbor could've heard Roger Podacter scream on the way down with that door shut. The scream she heard came from inside the apartment before he was thrown over the balcony and the murderer closed the door before he left. Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Can ya feel that, buddy? Huh? Huh? Huh?
- I have exorcised the demons... this house is clear.
%
- What would you know about pressure.
- Well, I have kissed a man.
%
- I swear if you do anything to embarass me in front of Camp...
- What? Like this?
- Aye, Captain Stubing. How are Gopher and Doc? Permission to come aboard, sir!
%
- Who is he, a friend?
- No, this is my date. He's a lawyer.
- Well, does he have a name, or should I call him "lawyer?"
- No, this is Ace... um, Tom Ace.
- Tom Ace. Pleasure to meet you Sir and may I congradulate you on all your success... you smell TEREFFIC! I was just telling Melissa that one of the first things we learned back at... Stanford Law... was the modern proliferation of food poisoning claims against wealthy, private homeowners. In fact, if one were so inclined, one could make quite a lucrative law practice on little else. How is everyone feeling tonight?
-  Very, very well, thank you.
%
- My esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino, has just brought some new evidence to my attention. Now, history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal investigator can be wrong from time to time. But if I am mistaken... if the Lieutenant is indeed a woman, as she claims to be... then, my friend, she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids I have *ever* seen!
- *That's* why Roger Podacter is dead! He found Captain Winkie!
%
-  Would you like an ashtray?
- Hmm-mmm. I don't smoke. It's a disgusting habit.
%
-  Shoot him! Shoot him!
-  Hold your fire!
- Don't shoot!
- Put your guns down or this cop gets it. I mean it!
- She's not joking!
-  He kidnapped Snowflake! He killed Roger Podator and was going to kill Dan Marino and meeeeee!
- Ho ho ho Hooooooooooooo! Fiction can be fun, but I find the reference section a little more enlightening. For instance, if you were to look up the NFL's "All Time Bonehead Plays," you might read about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle, who missed the 26 yard field goal in the closing seconds of Super Bowl XVII.
- What you wouldn't read about was how Ray Finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with Dan Marino for whom he blamed the entire thing!
- What the hell are you talking about?
- SHE'S NOT LOIS EINHORN!, She's Ray Finkle, she's a man.
- He's lying. SHOOT HIIIIMMM!
%
- How in the hell do you lose a five hundred pound fish?
- What?
- I'm sorry sir, I was just going to say, that it's not a fish, it's a mammal.
- Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.
%
- You really love animals, don't you?
- If it gets cold enough.
%
 I gotta go guys! I gotta date with your mothers!
%
-  Excuse me. I'd like to "ass" you a few questions.
- Ace, this is not the time. If Einhorn comes down here and sees me talking to you or your ass, I'm history.
%
- And somebody get me some coffee!
- Tonight on Miami Vice, Crockett gets the boss some coffee.
%
- I'm ready to go in, coach, just give me a chance. I know there's a lot of riding on it, but it's all psychological. Just gotta stay in a positive frame of mind.
-  I'm gonna execute a button-hook pattern, super slo-mo.
- Let's see that in an instant replay.
%
 Like a glove!
%
That was a close one ladies and gentleman. Unfortunately in every contest, there must be a loser. Loo-hoo-ser-her.
%
- Have you ever heard of FAN?
- Free Animals Now. Started in 1982, by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the famous industrialist Fisher Gamble. Over half a million members from Florida to Finland. No. Who are they?
%
- You're certain you had to open this door.
- Yeah, I'm certain.
- What's the point, Ventura?
- Only this.
%
Once you get inside my head, there's no turning back baby.
%
351, 351, Rover sit. Ha! Ha!
%
Gee, let me think. Um sure.
%
- What's the password?
- New England clam chowder.
- Is that the red or the white?
- Ah, I can never remember that. White.
- Yes.
%
- Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the bathroom.
- I think it's the pâté.
- Sure, right over there.
- Thanks! Stuff probably looks better on the way out, huh?
%
- I'll have the plumbing checked immediately, Mr. Ace.
- See that you do. If I'd been drinking out of the toilet, I might've been killed.
%
Warning. Assholes are closer than they appear.
%
- It's ALIVE. IT'S ALIVE.
%
- Alright, Ventura. Make it quick.
- I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank. It belonged to a 1984 AFC Championship ring. It would have been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray Finkle missed the big kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. We're talking mental institute escapee. I saw the guy's room. Cozy if you're Hannibal Lecter!
%
- Ace, Where are you?
- I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's the Mayor.
%
-  Please don't kill me. I'll never tell anyone. Kill him, he's the one you want.
- No, no kill him.
- No kill him. He held the ball wrong, remember? Come on, look at the guy.
- Cry-baby.
- Jock.
- Whimp.
- Muscle-head.
- SHUT UP.
%
Excuse me sir, but do you have a mint? Perhaps some Binaca?
%
- No problem, it gets flooded, we'll just wait a few seconds.
- Or we could try it now.
%
- WOW., Ray Finkle's house, I can't wait to meet him
- Ray ain't coming home
- But your wife said you expect him home any minute
- She expects him home any minute, see the engine's running but there's nobody behind the wheel. Eight years ago our son escaped from Shady Acres Mental Hospital in Tampa, and they're still bugging us to pick up his stuff.
%
- Ace?
-  Thought I left, didn't ya?
- 
- Ok, I'm really gonna go this time.
%
- "Replacement Kicker Having a Great Year." "Ready For Super Bowl, All-Star Kicker Boasts."
- "Field Goal Sails Wide. Dolphins Lose Super Bowl."
- The "Kick Heard Round The World." That was Finkle. The Dolphins lost by one point.
- Poor guy.
- Poor guy with a motive, baby.
%
Heads up! Good defense! Good defense!
%
- I don't give a good goddamn about that fish. Fillet it and fast food it if'ya want'to. All I give a damn about's, winning the Super Bowl. My athletes have got to have their heads in the right place. Shit, Roger, you been in this business a long time. You know how superstitious these guys are.
- I've got a quarterback who puts his socks on backwards, since high school. I've got a line backer who has not washed his jockey strap in two years because he thinks flies are lucky.
%
Lovely party. Pity I wasn't invited.
%
- DIE ANIMAL BOY!
- Quick Decision
%
Obsess much?
%
- You know what? I'm not even going to talk to you. Would you please leave.
- Why? So you can beat him?
- Fatty.
- You're unbelievable. Hiring you was the biggest mistake I ever made.
- Well, why don't you cry about it. Saddlebags.
%
- Why don't come to take a look inside? C'mon. C'mon!
- Go ahead. Snoop around!
- Well? Are you satisfied?
- Just don't let me catch you with an animal here, that's all.
- All right! Take care now! Bye-bye, then!
- L-oser!
%
-  I'm so Sorry Mr. Ace, I'll have the plumbing checked immediately.
- Well I hope so, had I been drinking out of the toilet, I might have been killed.
%
 Come to me my animal friends!
%
- Melissa, it's Ace!
- Ace, where are you?
- I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's the mayor!
%
- Has he always had a history of mental illness?
-  For as long as I've known him.
%
- The National Football League would like to extend a special thank-you to the man who rescued Dan Marino, and our beloved Snowflake...
- ...a great humanitarian, and lover of all animals, Mr. Ace Ventura!
%
All righty then!
%
Loo-oo-ser!
%
Snowflake. Here Snowflake. I've got a little snack for you.
%
Do not go in there. Woo!
%
Who let Dr. Dolittle in?
%
Yes, yes, oh yes! Can you feel that buddy? I have exorcised the demons. This house is clean.
%
- Where's Dan Marino?
- Marino, why?
- Because he's about to join Snowflake. I've got to know where he is.
%
Hi, I'm Dan Marino and if anyone knows the value of protection it's me.
%
Excuse me, gentleman. Pet Detective. Come on, what's the matter with you? Can't you hit me?
%
Your gun is digging into my hip.
%
Uncle Fester is looking for you.
%
- You've done some fine detective work... 'Ace'.
- I'm sorry. Could you please speak in to my good ear? I thought I heard you call me Ace.
%
- That's a lovely dog you have there Sir. Mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
- Alllrighty then.
%
Excuse me, yes. HDS coming through. I've got a package people
%
Hey Ventura, Ventura. Make any good collars lately, or were they leashes.
%
Gee, Chuck, the date started out good. Just before we got to the party she seemed to tense up.
%
Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet flush. Maybe somebody lost a turtle.
%
Receipts, what about receipts? There's gotta be receipts.
%
Half time!
%
Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle and Einhorn, Finkle, Einhorn, Einhorn, Finkle, Einhoen and Finkle, Finkle and Einhorn.
%
I have to have money to buy food. I have to have a dolphin to get the money. I don't see a dolphin around here, do you?
%
I need some refreshments, Dan. Would you like some refreshments, Dan? I'll be right back, Dan.
%
Hmmm, unconscious. Exactly as I planned.
%
- Who are you?
- Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. I've been sent in with a special play. Quarter back sneak
%
Be careful with that phone, Lieutenant. In time you could develop a tumour.
%
Good night, everybody. You've been a wonderful audience, I'll be here all week. Be sure to tip your waitress.
%
Come to me jungle friends.
%
Yummy!
%
- They're wonderful, aren't they?
- Yes, they certainly are.
- No matter what's going on in my life, I can always watch them swim and be totally at peace.
%
Holy shitballs.
%
Why did it have to happen now, two weeks before the Superbowl?
%
Where the hell's the smelt?
%
Oh there is just one more thing Lieutenant...
