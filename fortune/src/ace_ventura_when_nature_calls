- That's a lovely wrap you're wearing! Perhaps I could buy you some fluffy new slippers, made from the heads of innocent and defenseless baby seals!
- Who is this ghastly man?
- Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. And YOU must be the Monopoly guy! Hey.
- Thanks for the free parking.
- Another ACTIVIST, McGuire.
- Activist, yes
-  activist, yes, mhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm!
- Mr. Ventura, there is nothing wrong with enjoying the fruits of nature. You should try it sometime.
- Alrighty then!
- Do not pass go! Do not collect $200!
- It's lovely, but I fancy myself in autumn!
%
- Just what sort of bat are we talking about?
- The Great White Bat, of course.
- Corpus Kilochiroptera?
- Yes, but to the natives... Shikaka.
%
Shikaka... Shikaka! Shikasha! Ohhh! Shishkebab. Shawshank Redemption. ShicaaaaGO!
You're outta there! Go on, I gotcha, you're out.
%
- You're an extreme workaholic. You recently returned from a short trip to Gotan in northern Africa, and upon your return you more than likely took a nasty spill because of some... shotty masonry work.
- Very impressive... might I ask, how?
- Surely... The abrasion on the palm of your left hand is the type one sustains breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet; the small remnants of plaster on the tip of your shoe pointed to a careless mason being the culprit: your new watch, a quality forgery of a Cartier was most likely purchased through the north African black market known to reside in Gotan.
- And my work habits?
- Yes, a workaholic; the urine stain on your pants would signify that you're a single shake man, far too busy for the follow-up jiggle.
%
- That's what you slipped in! That's what was on your shoe! And that explains the abrasion on your palm! Let me run that back for you.
- Malp ruoy no noisarba eht snialpxe taht dna eohs ruoy no saw tahw staht ni deppils uoy tahw staht.
- That's what you slipped in! That's what was on your shoe! AND THAT EXPLAINS THE ABRASION ON YOUR PALM! DAMN I'M GOOD!
%
Nobody wants to play with me!
%
I'll have you know that I have the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose. Throw it. I DARE YOU!
%
- Bumbawe Atuna... Bumbawe Atuna...
- Hi there. Nice to see ya. Bumblebee tuna. Bumblebee tuna!
- Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! How are you this afternoon? Alrighty Then!
- Excuse me, your balls are showing.
- Bumblebee tuna.
%
- I'll meet you at the bottom. There's still one more thing I must do before I go...
- Isn't this incredible? IT'S GONNA BE SOME KIND OF A RECORD! Everyone loves a Slinky, you gotta get a Slinky, Slinky, Slinky, go Slinky go!
- Awww man! Can you believe it. It was right there!
%
There's someone on the wing! Some... THING! I'm sorry, what were you saying?
%
Of course. How sssselfish of me. Let's do all the things that YOU wanna do.
%
- My name is Fulton Greenwall, and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.
- No man here carries with him a label.
- Oh yes, no names. How silly of me. Well, um, he's an American.
- We are all children of the same life force.
- Yes of course we are.
- He bends over and speaks from his rear.
- Oh him. Right this way...
%
- We can pay you handsomely.
- I am now a child of light. Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- Re-he-he-eally? No. I cannot. For I am sorely needed... here, at the ashram.
- If I may interject! We're short of space, and it's important for you to use your talents. Let me help you pack.
- But I am yet to attain omnipresent supergalactic oneness.
- No. Wait. THERE it is!
- You've just attained it.
- I have?
- Yes! Just now! You are one! I can see it in your eyes. You're more one than anyone!
- What about my medallion of spiritual accomplishment?
- Take mine!
- This took you eighty years to achieve!
- That's okay. I don't like it anymore. Really.
- In the light of this great personal sacrifice you've made, I have no choice... but to take the case.
- Great! I'll go tell the others!
- Master... break it to them gently.
- I've never seen them like that before. Denial can be an ugly thing.
%
- You make me smile. And yet, I am troubled. You see, the man my father wants me to marry... I am worried I will not please him.
- I have never known a man.
- I would love to help. But you see, I have vowed to take a life of celibacy.
- Well, perhaps this will assist your decision.
- Those are very nice! But I am a child of light. A pure spirit. I am no longer encumbered by the appetites of the flesh.
%
Oh you pretty Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you. And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang love us, too. Hi, ho. Everywhere we go on Chitty Chitty we depend.

%
- Well, everything here seems good! Big load off my mind, aw God. You can speculate all you want, but unless you check it out for yourself, you never know!
- We should head back now.
- Don't you think you should investigate?
- There's no reason to go in there. Ever. I sense it as a holy man.
- But I thought you said...
- It's DARK! I could fall into a precipice!
-  him a torch] Here! Take this
- Spank you, Helpy Helperton.
%
If you were me, then I'd be you, and I'd use *your* body to get to the top. You can't stop me no matter who you are!
%
Cadby, from the consulate, right? This is weird!
%
- Peanut?
- Yes, I have one right here. It's bulky, but I consider it carry-on.
- Peanut.
%
- Kinda hot in these rhinos...
%
Guano bowls! Collect the whole set...
%
- What did he just say?
- I *think* he said, she's not a virgin.
- They can *tell* that?
%
You know, gingivitis is the number one cause of all tooth decay.
%
Where iz zhe bat?
%
- Well done, Ace! You must be very proud!
- Pride is an abomination. One must forego the self to obtain total spiritual creaminess, and avoid the chewy chunks of degradation.
%
Like a glove!
%
- What answer do you seek?
- I need to know what the Wachatis possess that is of great value to civilized man.
- The medallion will lead you to the answer. You do still have the medallion, don't you?
- Medallion? Why surely! I left it back, er, with my body.
- Your aura is weakening...
- OKAY! I threw it in the cave! What do you want from me? What are you, Mr. Perfect? You wanna know where it is? It's probably lying in a big pile of Guano! They have Guano!
%
- Guano! They have Guano!
%
I can feel it like it's right... In my neck!
%
- What are you going to do with that?
- Whatever I have to to get some answers.
%
- Did you just refer to me as "White Devil"?
- This how they know you.
- Leave that part out from now on.
%
Meeting with sinister types much? A not too much, a much too much.
%
It is the mucus that binds us.
%
- Mmm, this fruit paste is delicious. And the pottery is lovely.
- It's made from guano.
- Guano! Why's that sounding so familiar?
- Bat droppings.
- Guano is their main raw material, they're using it to made a lot of things in the village.
- Yummie!
%
- Ace, the Wachutus are a blood-thirsty, savage tribe. If they catch you, they will show no mercy!
- Worry not, my brother. For I will be as a fly on the wall - a grain of salt in the ocean. I will move amongst them like a transparent... *thing*.
%
- Greenwall, hit the lights! The switch on the wall beside you! Go for it!... Flick it, QUICK!
- Allrighty, then! Shall we go to jail?
%
Can you feel it, Captain Compost?
%
- Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?
- Of course not. This is a lovely room of death.
%
 Say hello to my STINKY little friend!
%
- Perhaps we should slow down just a teensy-weensy bit?
- Nonsense, Poopy-Pants!
%
Fe Fi Fo Fum! I smell... the fingerprints of scum!
%
 Hey! What are you? H. R. Shove 'n Stuff?
%
I was just... practicing my mantra.
%
 Look Spike!
%
-  They are a temple of the reproductive organs.
-  Do you have a dollar?
%
-  Are your legs sore? Do you want me to carry you?
- That's alright, I have an incredibly high threshold for pain
- *Holy Monkey!*
%
- Negative. No sign. Wait a second, I think I got him.
- You know you could poke somebody's eyes out with that thing.
%
Loo-oo-ser!
%
All righty then.
%
Do I have something in my teeth?
%
They did not know about disease until the white man came.
%
Gravy.
%
I'm fighting something.
%
Say uncle! Say uncle!
%
Gang way baby!
%
Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!
%
Nobody wants to play with me.
%
 Chief says you make him laugh! You are like sissy girl!
%
Leh-hew-zee-hur.
%
Friends, rodents, quadrupeds, lend me your rears!
%
Your request is not unlike your lower intestine: stinky and loaded with danger.
%
 "Wunderbar!", he exclaimed with great relish.
